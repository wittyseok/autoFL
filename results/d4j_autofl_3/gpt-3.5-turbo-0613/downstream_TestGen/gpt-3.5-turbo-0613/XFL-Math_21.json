This test creates three real matrices `m1`, `m2`, and `m3` using `MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix`. Each matrix is then subjected to the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` algorithm by calling the constructor with the matrix and a small threshold value. After that, the `getRootMatrix` method is called to obtain the root matrix, and the test verifies that the difference between the original matrix and the product of the root matrix and its transpose is within a certain tolerance.\n\nThe test failed with an `AssertionFailedError` at line 108, indicating that the expected value of `0.0` is not equal to the actual value of `0.0180652917341963`.\n\nThe `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class has two relevant methods:\n1. The constructor `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition(RealMatrix matrix, double small)` decomposes a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix to obtain its root matrix.

The `getRootMatrix()` method returns the root of the covariance matrix.\n\nBased on the code and comments, it appears that the failure in the `testMath789` test occurred because the difference between `m3` and `rebuiltM3` is not within the expected tolerance of `1.0e-16`. \n\nTo further investigate the issue, we need to examine the implementation of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class, specifically the constructor and the `getRootMatrix` method.\nBased on the code and comments, it seems that the bug occurs in the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class. The `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` constructor is responsible for decomposing a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix into its root matrix. However, the failure in the `testMath789` test suggests that the computed root matrix is not correct.\n\nTo fix this bug, we need to investigate the implementation of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class and identify any issues that could lead to incorrect computations of the root matrix.

This test creates three real matrices `m1`, `m2`, and `m3` using `MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix`. Each matrix is then subjected to the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` algorithm by calling the constructor with the matrix and a small threshold value. After that, the `getRootMatrix` method is called to obtain the root matrix, and the test verifies that the difference between the original matrix and the product of the root matrix and its transpose is within a certain tolerance.\n\nThe test failed with an `AssertionFailedError` at line 108, indicating that the expected value of `0.0` is not equal to the actual value of `0.0180652917341963`.\n\nThe `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class has two relevant methods:\n1. The constructor `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition(RealMatrix matrix, double small)` decomposes a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix to obtain its root matrix. It throws a `NonPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` if the matrix is not positive semidefinite.\n2. The `getRootMatrix()` method returns the root of the covariance matrix.\n\nBased on the code and comments, it appears that the failure in the `testMath789` test occurred because the difference between `m3` and `rebuiltM3` is not within the expected tolerance of `1.0e-16`. \n\nTo further investigate the issue, we need to examine the implementation of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class, specifically the constructor and the `getRootMatrix` method.\nBased on the code and comments, it seems that the bug occurs in the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class. The `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` constructor is responsible for decomposing a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix into its root matrix. However, the failure in the `testMath789` test suggests that the computed root matrix is not correct.\n\nTo fix this bug, we need to investigate the implementation of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class and identify any issues that could lead to incorrect computations of the root matrix. Specifically, we should examine the logic for finding the maximal diagonal element, swapping elements, and checking the diagonal elements.\n\nOne possible fix could be to review the logic for swapping elements and ensure that it is performed correctly. Additionally, we should check the computation of the diagonal elements and ensure that they are calculated accurately.\n\nHere are the suggested methods that could be fixed:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition(org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RealMatrix, double)\norg.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix()\n```\n\nPlease note that these suggestions are based on the information provided and may require further investigation and analysis of the source code."
