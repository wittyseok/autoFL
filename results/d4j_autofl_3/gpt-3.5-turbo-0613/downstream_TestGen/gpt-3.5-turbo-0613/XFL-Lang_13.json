Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

From the code snippet, we can see that the method tries to clone a given object `object` by serializing and deserializing it.\n\nThe error message `ClassNotFoundException while reading cloned object data` suggests that there is a problem with deserializing the object. Looking at the code, the deserialization happens in the following line:\n\n```java\nT readObject = (T) in.readObject();\n```\n\nThe `in` variable is an instance of the `ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream` class, which is used to read the serialized object's data. The `ClassNotFoundException` is thrown when the deserialization process cannot find the class definition for the serialized data.\n\nIn this case, the error message specifically mentions `byte` as the missing class. This suggests that the `ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream` is unable to resolve the `byte` class during deserialization, resulting in the exception.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, we need to analyze the `ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream` class."
