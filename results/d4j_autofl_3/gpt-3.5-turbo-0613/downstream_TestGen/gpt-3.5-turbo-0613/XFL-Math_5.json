The failing test `org.apache.commons.math3.complex.ComplexTest.testReciprocalZero` calls the `reciprocal` method of the `Complex` class.\n2. The `reciprocal` method first checks if the complex number is NaN (not a number). If it is NaN, it returns NaN as the reciprocal.\n3. Next, it checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both zero. If they are, it returns NaN as the reciprocal.\n4. Then, it checks if the complex number is infinite. If it is, it returns zero as the reciprocal.\n5. If the complex number is not NaN, zero, or infinite, it calculates the reciprocal as follows:\n   - If the absolute value of the real part is less than the absolute value of the imaginary part, it calculates `q = real / imaginary` and `scale = 1.0 / (real * q + imaginary)`. Then it returns a new `Complex` object with the values `scale * q` as the real part and `-scale` as the imaginary part.\n   - If the absolute value of the real part is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the imaginary part, it calculates `q = imaginary / real` and `scale = 1.0 / (imaginary * q + real)`. Then it returns a new `Complex` object with the values `scale` as the real part and `-scale * q` as the imaginary part.\n\nBased on this analysis, the bug seems to be in the calculation of the reciprocal when the complex number is zero. The current implementation returns NaN instead of Infinity, which caused the test to fail.\n\nThe suggested locations to fix the bug are:\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.complex.Complex.reciprocal()`\nSuggested locations to fix the bug:\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.complex.Complex.reciprocal()`"
