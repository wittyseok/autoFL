However, there is a bug in the code handling the parsing of the entity value.\n\nAt line 65, the method tries to parse the entity value from the `input` using `Integer.parseInt` method. However, it is not considering the range of the `end` index when extracting the entity substring from `input`. This can result in a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` when the `end` index is greater than or equal to the length of the `input` string.\n\nIn the failing test case, the input string is `\"Test &#x30 not test\"`. The `start` index is set to 5, and the `end` index is determined by iterating until a `;` is found. However, since the `;` is not present in the input string, the loop continues until it reaches the end of the `input` string. This causes `end` to become equal to the length of `input`, resulting in the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` when the substring is extracted at line 62.\n\nTo fix the bug, the code needs to include a condition to check if the `end` index is within the valid range of the `input` length.\n\nBased on our analysis, the bug occurs in the `NumericEntityUnescaper.translate(CharSequence, int, Writer)` method.\nTo fix the bug, the `NumericEntityUnescaper.translate(CharSequence, int, Writer)` method should be modified to include a condition to check if the `end` index is within the valid range of the `input` length before extracting the entity substring.\n\nHere are the methods that should be modified:\n\n- `NumericEntityUnescaper.translate(CharSequence, int, Writer)`\n\n(`org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.NumericEntityUnescaper.translate(CharSequence, int, java.io.Writer)`)"
