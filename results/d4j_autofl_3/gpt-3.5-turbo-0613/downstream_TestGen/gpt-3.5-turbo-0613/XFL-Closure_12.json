It does not have any JavaDoc documentation available.\n\nTo summarize the issue:\n- The test `testIssue794b` in the `FlowSensitiveInlineVariablesTest` class failed.\n- The test calls the `noInline` method with a JavaScript code snippet as the argument.\n- The expected and actual results of the test differ, indicating a mismatch in the generated JavaScript function.\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to investigate how the `noInline` method processes the given JavaScript code snippet and ensure that it generates the expected JavaScript function."

The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
