Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This method takes a `PeriodType` as input and returns a normalized `Period` object based on that type.\n\nLooking at the code snippet of the `normalizedStandard` method, we can see that it first calculates the total duration in milliseconds by summing up the individual components of the `Period` (lines 1618-1623). Then, it creates a new `Period` object with the calculated duration, the input `PeriodType`, and the UTC chronology (line 1624).\n\nNext, it checks if there are non-zero values for years and months in the `Period` (lines 1625-1636). If there are, it adjusts the years and months values to be within the valid ranges and updates the `Period` object accordingly.\n\nBased on the error message and call stack, it seems that the issue is happening in the `withYears` method, which is called in line 1631. Let's investigate the `withYears` method to understand the cause of the error.\n\nCall the `get_code_snippet` function with the signature \"org.joda.time.Period.withYears(int)\"."
