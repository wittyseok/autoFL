However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

It then sets the `stopTime` to the current system time and updates the `runningState` to `STATE_STOPPED`.\n\nNext, let's examine the `testLang315` method again to see why it failed.\nThe `testLang315` method tests whether the `suspendTime` and `totalTime` variables of the `StopWatch` object are equal. Here's the code snippet again:\n\n```java\n...\nStopWatch watch = new StopWatch();\nwatch.start();\ntry {Thread.sleep(200);} catch (InterruptedException ex) {}\nwatch.suspend();\nlong suspendTime = watch.getTime();\ntry {Thread.sleep(200);} catch (InterruptedException ex) {}\nwatch.stop();\nlong totalTime = watch.getTime();\nassertTrue(suspendTime == totalTime); // error occurred here\n...\n```\n\nThe test failed with the following error message:\n\n```\njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError\n\tat org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatchTest.testLang315(StopWatchTest.java:120)\n```\n\nThe error occurred on line 120 where the `assertTrue` statement is located.\n\nLet's analyze the code further to understand the cause of the failure."
