This method is responsible for reducing, or simplifying, a fraction to its simplest form.\n\nThe `getReducedFraction(int, int)` method checks if the denominator is zero and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it is. Then, it checks if the numerator is zero and returns a fraction representing zero. Next, it checks if the denominator is the minimum value of `Integer` and if the numerator is even.

This method follows a binary algorithm to efficiently find the GCD.\n\nThe `reduce()` method of the `Fraction` class is responsible for reducing a fraction to its simplest form. It first checks if the numerator is zero and returns the appropriate fraction. Then, it calculates the GCD of the absolute values of the numerator and denominator.

The incorrect reduction of the fraction might be causing the incorrect result in the test.\n\nTo fix the issue, the `reduce()` method or the `greatestCommonDivisor(int, int)` method should be modified to correctly find the greatest common divisor and reduce the fraction to its simplest form.\n\nSuggested fixes:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.reduce()`\n- `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.greatestCommonDivisor(int, int)`"
