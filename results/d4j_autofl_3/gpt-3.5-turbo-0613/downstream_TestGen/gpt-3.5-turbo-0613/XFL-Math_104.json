The test calls the method `testRegularizedGamma` with the arguments `0.632120558828558, 1.0, 1.0` at line 77, but the expected result is `0.632120558828558`, while the actual result is `0.6321205587649603`. \n\nBy examining the failing test, we can see that it is testing the method `regularizedGammaQ` or `regularizedGammaP` in the `Gamma` class. Let's fetch the code snippets for these methods to get a better understanding of their implementation.\n\nThe code snippet for the `regularizedGammaP` method is as follows:\n\n```java\n117 : public static double regularizedGammaP(double a, double x)\n118 :     throws MathException\n119 : {\n120 :     return regularizedGammaP(a, x, DEFAULT_EPSILON, Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n121 : }\n```\n\nThe code snippet for the `regularizedGammaQ` method is as follows:\n\n```java\n197 : public static double regularizedGammaQ(double a, double x)\n198 :     throws MathException\n199 : {\n200 :     return regularizedGammaQ(a, x, DEFAULT_EPSILON, Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n201 : }\n```\n\nBased on the code snippets, it seems that the failing test is calling either the `regularizedGammaP` or `regularizedGammaQ` method, but we cannot determine which one from the failing test alone.\n\nNext, let's suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.\nThe following methods would be the best locations to be fixed:\n\norg.apache.commons.math.special.Gamma.regularizedGammaP(double, double)\norg.apache.commons.math.special.Gamma.regularizedGammaQ(double, double)"
