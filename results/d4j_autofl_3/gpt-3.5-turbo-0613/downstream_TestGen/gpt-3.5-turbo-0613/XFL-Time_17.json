Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

In this scenario, there are two valid offsets\nfor the local date-time. Calling this method will return a date-time with the\nlater of the two selected.\n\nIf this method is called when it is not an overlap, this is returned.\n\nThis instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.\n```\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that the method should return a `DateTime` instance with the later offset when there is a local time-line overlap. However, in the failing test, the actual value returned by the method has a different offset than the expected value.\n\nTo fix the issue, the implementation of the `withLaterOffsetAtOverlap` method should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure that it correctly returns the `DateTime` instance with the later offset during local time-line overlaps.\n\nPossible fix:\n```\norg.joda.time.DateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()\n```"
