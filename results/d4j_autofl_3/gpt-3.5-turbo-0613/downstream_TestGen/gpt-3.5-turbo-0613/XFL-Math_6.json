Here is the code snippet for this method:\n\n```java\n474 :     private void doTest(MultivariateFunction func,\n475 :                         double[] startPoint,\n476 :                         double[] inSigma,\n477 :                         double[][] boundaries,\n478 :                         GoalType goal,\n479 :                         int lambda,\n480 :                         boolean isActive,\n481 :                         int diagonalOnly,\n482 :                         double stopValue,\n483 :                         double fTol,\n484 :                         double pointTol,\n485 :                         int maxEvaluations,\n486 :                         PointValuePair expected) {\n487 :         int dim = startPoint.length;\n488 :         // test diagonalOnly = 0 - slow but normally fewer feval#\n489 :         CMAESOptimizer optim = new CMAESOptimizer(30000, stopValue, isActive, diagonalOnly,\n490 :                                                   0, new MersenneTwister(), false, null);\n491 :         PointValuePair result = boundaries == null ?\n492 :             optim.optimize(new MaxEval(maxEvaluations),\n493 :                            new ObjectiveFunction(func),\n494 :                            goal,\n495 :                            new InitialGuess(startPoint),\n496 :                            SimpleBounds.unbounded(dim),\n497 :                            new CMAESOptimizer.Sigma(inSigma),\n498 :                            new CMAESOptimizer.PopulationSize(lambda)) :\n499 :             optim.optimize(new MaxEval(maxEvaluations),\n500 :                            new ObjectiveFunction(func),\n501 :                            goal,\n502 :                            new SimpleBounds(boundaries[0],\n503 :                                             boundaries[1]),\n504 :                            new InitialGuess(startPoint),\n505 :                            new CMAESOptimizer.Sigma(inSigma),\n506 :                            new CMAESOptimizer.PopulationSize(lambda));\n\n508 :         // System.out.println(\"sol=\" + Arrays.toString(result.getPoint()));\n509 :         Assert.assertEquals(expected.getValue(), result.getValue(), fTol);\n510 :         for (int i = 0; i < dim; i++) {\n511 :             Assert.assertEquals(expected.getPoint()[i], result.getPoint()[i], pointTol);\n512 :         }\n\n514 :         Assert.assertTrue(optim.getIterations() > 0);\n515 :     }\n```\n\nThe `doTest` method takes several parameters, including `MultivariateFunction func`, `double[] startPoint`, `double[] inSigma`, `double[][] boundaries`, `GoalType goal`, `int lambda`, `boolean isActive`, `int diagonalOnly`, `double stopValue`, `double fTol`, `double pointTol`, `int maxEvaluations`, and `PointValuePair expected`.\n\nIn the `doTest` method, an instance of `CMAESOptimizer` is created with the specified parameters. The `optimize` method of `CMAESOptimizer` is then called to perform the optimization. The result of the optimization is compared with the expected result using assertions.\n\nBased on the provided information, it seems that the issue may not be directly related to the `doTest` method itself, but rather to the `new ElliRotated()` object being passed as one of the arguments. More information about the `ElliRotated` class and its behavior is needed to identify the root cause of the failure."
