Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This test is checking for the expected exception `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` when creating a `CholeskyDecompositionImpl` object with a specific matrix. However, the test failed with an `AssertionFailedError` indicating that the expected exception was not thrown.\n\nTo investigate further, I looked at the code of the `CholeskyDecompositionImpl` constructor, which takes a `RealMatrix` object as input. The constructor is defined as follows:\n\n```java\npublic CholeskyDecompositionImpl(final RealMatrix matrix)\n    throws NonSquareMatrixException,\n           NotSymmetricMatrixException, NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException {\n    this(matrix, DEFAULT_RELATIVE_SYMMETRY_THRESHOLD,\n         DEFAULT_ABSOLUTE_POSITIVITY_THRESHOLD);\n}\n```\n\nFrom the constructor code and the provided test code, it seems that the `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` is expected to be thrown if the input matrix is not positive definite. However, the test failure suggests that the exception was not thrown as expected.\n\nNext steps:\n- Review the implementation of the `CholeskyDecompositionImpl` constructor to determine if it correctly throws the `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` when necessary.\n- Check if there are any additional test cases that cover the functionality of the `CholeskyDecompositionImpl` class.\n\nPossible fixes:\n- `org.apache.commons.math.linear.CholeskyDecompositionImpl.CholeskyDecompositionImpl(org.apache.commons.math.linear.RealMatrix)`\nThe bug seems to be in the `CholeskyDecompositionImpl` constructor. It is expected to throw a `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` if the input matrix is not positive definite. However, the test `testMath274` is failing because the exception is not thrown as expected.\n\nTo fix this issue, the implementation of the `CholeskyDecompositionImpl` constructor needs to be reviewed and modified to correctly handle the case when the input matrix is not positive definite.\n\nPotential fix:\n- `org.apache.commons.math.linear.CholeskyDecompositionImpl.CholeskyDecompositionImpl(org.apache.commons.math.linear.RealMatrix)`"
