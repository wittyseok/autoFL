Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

Here is the code snippet for the `createNumber` method in the `org.apache.commons.lang.math.NumberUtils` class:\n\n```java\n397 : public static Number createNumber(String str) throws NumberFormatException {\n398 :     if (str == null) {\n399 :         return null;\n400 :     }\n401 :     if (StringUtils.isBlank(str)) {\n402 :         throw new NumberFormatException(\"A blank string is not a valid number\");\n403 :     }  \n404 :     if (str.startsWith(\"--\")) {\n405 :         // this is protection for poorness in java.lang.BigDecimal.\n406 :         // it accepts this as a legal value, but it does not appear \n407 :         // to be in specification of class.

In line 437, it sets the variable `dec` to `null` if there is no decimal point in the input string. Then, it checks if the last character of the string `str` is a non-digit character in line 440.\n\nIn this particular test case, the input string is `\"1l\"`. Since there is no decimal point in the string, the variable `dec` is set to `null`. The last character of the string is `'l'`, which is a non-digit character. As a result, the code falls into the `default` case in line 496 and throws a `NumberFormatException` with the message `\"1l is not a valid number.\"`.\n\nThis explains why the test failed with the given error message.\n\nTo fix this issue, the code should handle the case of a non-digit character at the end of the string differently, depending on the requirements of the application. For example, it could ignore the non-digit character if it does not affect the validity of the number representation.\n\nHere are the methods in need of fixing:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang.math.NumberUtils.createNumber(java.lang.String)`"
