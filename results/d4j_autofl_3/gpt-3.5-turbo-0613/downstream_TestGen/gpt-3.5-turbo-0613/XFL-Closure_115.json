However, the actual result is also `\"o.x=2\"`. The error message indicates that the failure is due to \"Node tree inequality\". This suggests that the comparison between the expected and actual results involves some kind of tree structure, possibly related to the JavaScript syntax tree.\n\nTo further investigate the cause of the failure, we need more information about the code being tested. Please provide the code snippet for the method `testNoInlineIfParametersModified8` in the `com.google.javascript.jscomp.InlineFunctionsTest` class by calling the `get_code_snippet` function."

The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
