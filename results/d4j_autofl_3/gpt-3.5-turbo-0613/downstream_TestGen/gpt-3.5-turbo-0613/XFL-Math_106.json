The test is intentionally providing an input string `\"2 -2 / 3\"` with an invalid minus sign in an improper fraction to test that the `ParseException` is thrown.\n\nSince the test is failing with the assertion message `invalid minus in improper fraction.`, it suggests that the `ParseException` is not being thrown when it should be.\nBased on the failing test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` and the code snippets we retrieved, it appears that the test is checking for the expected behavior of the `parse` method in the `FractionFormat` class. \n\nThe test is intentionally providing an input string `\"2 -2 / 3\"` with an invalid minus sign in an improper fraction, and it expects a `ParseException` to be thrown. However, the test is failing with the assertion message `invalid minus in improper fraction.`, indicating that the `ParseException` is not being thrown.\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `parse` method in the `FractionFormat` class to correctly handle the invalid minus sign in an improper fraction and throw a `ParseException` when encountered.\n\nThe suggested method to fix is:\n- `org.apache.commons.math.fraction.FractionFormat.parse(java.lang.String)`"
