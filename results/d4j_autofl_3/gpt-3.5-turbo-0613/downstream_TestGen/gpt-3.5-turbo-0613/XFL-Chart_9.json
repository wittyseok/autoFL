Both methods are used to create a new `TimeSeries` object by copying a subset of the data from the original time series.\n\nThe first version of the `createCopy` method takes integer indices as arguments. It checks if the start index is less than 0 and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. It also checks if the end index is less than the start index and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. This is the version of the method that is being called in the test.\n\nThe second version of the `createCopy` method takes `RegularTimePeriod` objects as arguments. It checks if the start argument is null and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. It also checks if the end argument is null and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. It also checks if the start period is after the end period and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. If the start and end periods are valid, it calls the first version of the `createCopy` method with the corresponding indices.\n\nBased on the code and the error message, it seems that the start index (1) is greater than the end index (12) when calling the `createCopy` method. This violates the requirement that the start index must be less than or equal to the end index, leading to the `IllegalArgumentException` being thrown.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Update the test `testBug1864222` in the `TimeSeriesTests` class to provide valid arguments for the `createCopy` method, ensuring that the start index is less than or equal to the end index.\n\nAlternatively, if it is permissible to update the implementation of the `createCopy` method:\n- Modify the `createCopy` method to handle the case where the start index is greater than the end index, possibly by swapping the values or returning an empty time series.\n\nAffected method:\n- org.jfree.data.time.TimeSeries.createCopy(int, int)\n\nAffected test:\n- org.jfree.data.time.TimeSeriesTests.testBug1864222"
