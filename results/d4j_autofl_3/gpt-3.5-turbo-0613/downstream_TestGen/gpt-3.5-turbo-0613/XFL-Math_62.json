It then creates a `JDKRandomGenerator` and sets its seed to 4312000053L. Finally, it creates a `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` with `underlying` as the base optimizer, 5 as the number of starts, and the generated random generator `g`.\n\nThe `optimize` method is called on the optimizer with the `f` function, `GoalType.MINIMIZE`, and the range -0.3 to -0.2. The returned optimum value is compared to -0.2719561293 using the `assertEquals` method.\n\nThe test failure indicates that the expected value -0.2719561293 does not match the actual value -0.2719561278056452.\n\nTo better understand the issue, let's look at the `optimize` method of the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class.\n\n```java\n142: public UnivariateRealPointValuePair optimize(final FUNC f,\n143:                                              final GoalType goal,\n144:                                              final double min, final double max)\n145:     throws FunctionEvaluationException {\n146:     return optimize(f, goal, min, max, 0);\n147: }\n```\n\nUnfortunately, the code snippet does not provide much information about what happens inside the `optimize` method. The documentation for this method is not available either.\n\nConsidering the nature of the failure, where the actual value is very close to the expected value, it is likely that there is a small numerical precision issue within the `optimize` method that causes a slight difference in the returned optimum.\n\nTo further investigate the issue and suggest a specific fix, we would need more information about the implementation of the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer.optimize` method and any related methods.\nBased on the available information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the issue and suggest a specific fix. However, based on the failing test `testQuinticMin` and the failing method `optimize` in the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class, here are some potential methods that could be investigated and fixed:\n\n- `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.univariate.MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer.optimize(FUNC, org.apache.commons.math.optimization.GoalType, double, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.univariate.AbstractUnivariateRealOptimizer.optimize(FUNC, org.apache.commons.math.optimization.GoalType, double, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.univariate.BrentOptimizer.optimize(FUNC, org.apache.commons.math.optimization.GoalType, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.univariate.AbstractUnivariateRealOptimizer.optimizeInternal(int)`\n\nPlease note that these suggestions are based on the available information and may not accurately reflect the specific locations that need to be fixed.

Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is.

It then creates a `JDKRandomGenerator` and sets its seed to 4312000053L. Finally, it creates a `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` with `underlying` as the base optimizer, 5 as the number of starts, and the generated random generator `g`.\n\nThe `optimize` method is called on the optimizer with the `f` function, `GoalType.MINIMIZE`, and the range -0.3 to -0.2. The returned optimum value is compared to -0.2719561293 using the `assertEquals` method.\n\nThe test failure indicates that the expected value -0.2719561293 does not match the actual value -0.2719561278056452.\n\nTo better understand the issue, let's look at the `optimize` method of the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class.\n\n```java\n142: public UnivariateRealPointValuePair optimize(final FUNC f,\n143:                                              final GoalType goal,\n144:                                              final double min, final double max)\n145:     throws FunctionEvaluationException {\n146:     return optimize(f, goal, min, max, 0);\n147: }\n```\n\nUnfortunately, the code snippet does not provide much information about what happens inside the `optimize` method. The documentation for this method is not available either.\n\nConsidering the nature of the failure, where the actual value is very close to the expected value, it is likely that there is a small numerical precision issue within the `optimize` method that causes a slight difference in the returned optimum.\n\nTo further investigate the issue and suggest a specific fix, we would need more information about the implementation of the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer.optimize` method and any related methods.\nBased on the available information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the issue and suggest a specific fix. However, based on the failing test `testQuinticMin` and the failing method `optimize` in the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class, here are some potential methods that could be investigated and fixed:\n\n- `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.univariate.MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer.optimize(FUNC, org.apache.commons.math.optimization.GoalType, double, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.univariate.AbstractUnivariateRealOptimizer.optimize(FUNC, org.apache.commons.math.optimization.GoalType, double, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.univariate.BrentOptimizer.optimize(FUNC, org.apache.commons.math.optimization.GoalType, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.univariate.AbstractUnivariateRealOptimizer.optimizeInternal(int)`\n\nPlease note that these suggestions are based on the available information and may not accurately reflect the specific locations that need to be fixed.
