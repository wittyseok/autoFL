Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This leads to incorrect property comparison and building of the least supertype.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we need to modify the `getLeastSupertype` method in the `RecordType` class to call the correct methods from the `PrototypeObjectType` class.\n\nHere are the methods that need to be fixed:\n\n```\ncom.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.getLeastSupertype(com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.JSType)\n```\n\nThe fix for the issue involves modifying the code as follows:\n\n```java\n140 :   @Override\n141 :   public JSType getLeastSupertype(JSType that) {\n142 :     if (!that.isRecordType()) {\n143 :       return super.getLeastSupertype(that);\n144 :     }\n145 :     RecordTypeBuilder builder = new RecordTypeBuilder(registry);\n146 :     for (String property : properties.keySet()) {\n147 :       if (that.toMaybeRecordType().toMaybePrototypeObjectType().hasProperty(property) &&\n148 :           that.toMaybeRecordType().toMaybePrototypeObjectType().getPropertyType(property).isEquivalentTo(\n149 :               getPropertyType(property))) {\n150 :         builder.addProperty(property, getPropertyType(property),\n151 :             getPropertyNode(property));\n152 :       }\n153 :     }\n154 :     return builder.build();\n155 :   }\n```\n\nPlease fix the code accordingly."
