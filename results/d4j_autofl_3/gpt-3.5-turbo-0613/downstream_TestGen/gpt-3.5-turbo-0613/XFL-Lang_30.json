Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

Here is the JavaDoc documentation for the method:\n\n```java\n/**\n * Checks if the CharSequence contains any character in the given set of characters.\n *\n * A null CharSequence will return false. A null or zero-length search array will return false.\n *\n * Examples:\n * StringUtils.containsAny(null, *)                = false\n * StringUtils.containsAny(\"\", *)                  = false\n * StringUtils.containsAny(*, null)                = false\n * StringUtils.containsAny(*, [])                  = false\n * StringUtils.containsAny(\"zzabyycdxx\",['z','a']) = true\n * StringUtils.containsAny(\"zzabyycdxx\",['b','y']) = true\n * StringUtils.containsAny(\"aba\", ['z'])           = false\n *\n * @param cs  the CharSequence to check, may be null\n * @param searchChars  the chars to search for, may be null\n * @return the true if any of the chars are found, false if no match or null input\n * @since 2.4\n */\n```\n\nThe documentation states that a `null` `CharSequence` will return `false`, as well as a `null` or zero-length `searchChars` array. It also provides various examples of valid inputs and their expected results.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the `testContainsAny_StringCharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` test is expecting `StringUtils.containsAny(CharUSuppCharLow, CharU20001.toCharArray())` to return `false`, but it is actually returning `true`. This is why the assertion in the test failed.\n\nTo debug the issue further, we need to look at the values of `CharUSuppCharLow` and `CharU20001` that are being passed as arguments to the `containsAny` method.\nTo further diagnose the issue, we need to examine the values of `CharUSuppCharLow` and `CharU20001` that are being passed as arguments to the `StringUtils.containsAny` method. \n\nPlease provide the values of `CharUSuppCharLow` and `CharU20001` so that we can analyze their contents."
