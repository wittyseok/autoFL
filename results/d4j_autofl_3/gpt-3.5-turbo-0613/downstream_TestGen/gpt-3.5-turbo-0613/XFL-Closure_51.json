Looking at the code of the `assertPrint` method, it first validates the expected string by calling the `parse` method with the expected string as the argument.

The `parse` method is called in the `parsePrint` method with the input string as the argument. Inside the `parse` method, a new `Compiler` object is created, and the `CompilerOptions` object is initialized with options that allow getters and setters.
