The failing test `testDigitLimitConstructor` creates a new `BigFraction` object with the constructor `BigFraction(double, double, int, int)`.\n2. Inside the constructor, the input values are processed to determine the numerator and denominator of the fraction.\n3. The constructor uses an iterative algorithm to compute the fraction. It starts by initializing some variables and performing initial checks.\n4. The algorithm then enters a loop where it calculates a series of approximations for the fraction until a convergence condition is met.\n5. In each iteration of the loop, a new approximation is calculated using the formula `final double r1 = 1.0 / (r0 - a0);`.\n6. The numerator and denominator of the current approximation are updated using the formulas `p2 = (a1 * p1) + p0;` and `q2 = (a1 * q1) + q0;`.\n7. If the numerator or denominator exceeds a certain limit (`overflow`), a `FractionConversionException` is thrown.\n8. If the approximation is close enough to the target value, the loop stops and the final numerator and denominator are determined.\n9. In the failing test, the target value is `0.5000000001` and the `maxDenominator` value is `10`.\n10. During the calculation of the approximation, the numerator or denominator exceeds the `overflow` limit, causing a `FractionConversionException` to be thrown.\n11.

If the numerator or denominator exceeds a certain limit (`overflow`), a `FractionConversionException` is thrown.\n8. If the approximation is close enough to the target value, the loop stops and the final numerator and denominator are determined.\n9. In the failing test, the target value is `0.5000000001` and the `maxDenominator` value is `10`.\n10. During the calculation of the approximation, the numerator or denominator exceeds the `overflow` limit, causing a `FractionConversionException` to be thrown.\n11. This exception is not caught in the test method, resulting in a test failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that the algorithm used in the `BigFraction` class to compute the fraction approximation is not working correctly in this specific case. The limit checks for the numerator and denominator should be updated to handle larger values without overflowing.\n\nThe suggested methods to fix are:\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.BigFraction.BigFraction(double, double, int, int)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.BigFraction.BigFraction(java.math.BigInteger, java.math.BigInteger)`"
