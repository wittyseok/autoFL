                "content": "The `getSumSquaredErrors()` method in the `SimpleRegression` class returns the sum of squared errors (SSE) associated with the regression model. The sum is computed using the formula:\n\n```\nSSE = SYY - (SXY * SXY / SXX)\n```\n\nwhere\n- `SYY` is the sum of the squared deviations of the y values about their mean,\n- `SXX` is the sum of the squared deviations of the x values about their mean,\n- `SXY` is the sum of the products of the x and y mean deviations.\n\nThe sums are accumulated using the updating algorithm referenced in the `addData(double, double)` method.\n\nThe return value is constrained to be non-negative. If, due to rounding errors, the computational formula returns a negative result, 0 is returned.\n\nThe method has preconditions:\n- At least two observations (with at least two different x values) must have been added before invoking this method. If this method is invoked before a model can be estimated, `Double.NaN` is returned.\nBased on the information gathered, here is a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred:\n\n1. The failing test `testSSENonNegative` creates an instance of `SimpleRegression` and adds data points using the `addData(double, double)` method.\n2. The `addData(double, double)` method updates the internal variables `sumXX`, `sumYY`, `sumXY`, `xbar`, `ybar`, `sumX`, `sumY`, and `n` based on the provided data points.\n3. The `getSumSquaredErrors()` method calculates and returns the sum of squared errors using the formula `SSE = SYY - (SXY * SXY / SXX)`.\n4. The failing assertion checks whether the calculated sum of squared errors is greater than or equal to 0. If the assertion fails, an `AssertionFailedError` is thrown.\n5. The test failed at line 275 because the calculated sum of squared errors was not greater than or equal to 0.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that the bug lies in the calculation of the sum of squared errors in the `getSumSquaredErrors()` method."
