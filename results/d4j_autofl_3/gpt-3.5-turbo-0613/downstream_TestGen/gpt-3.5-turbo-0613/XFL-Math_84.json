The test is using the `MultiDirectional` optimizer to minimize a given function.\n2. The optimizer is set up with a convergence checker, maximum number of iterations, and a starting configuration.\n3. The optimization is performed by calling the `optimize` method of the optimizer and passing the objective function, goal type (in this case, `MINIMIZE`), and an initial guess.\n4. During the optimization process, the `iterateSimplex` method is called in a loop to iteratively update the simplex.\n5. Inside the `iterateSimplex` method, the original simplex is saved and the best point is extracted.\n6. A reflection step is performed by evaluating a new simplex using the `evaluateNewSimplex` method with a reflection coefficient of 1.0.\n7. If the reflected simplex is better than the best point, an expanded simplex is computed and accepted if it is better than the reflected simplex.\n8. If the reflected simplex is not better than the best point, a contracted simplex is computed and accepted if it is better than the best point.\n9. The convergence of the optimization is checked and the loop continues until convergence is reached or the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.\n\nBased on the code snippets, the bug could potentially be caused by an issue in the `evaluateNewSimplex` method.

Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The test is using the `MultiDirectional` optimizer to minimize a given function.\n2. The optimizer is set up with a convergence checker, maximum number of iterations, and a starting configuration.\n3. The optimization is performed by calling the `optimize` method of the optimizer and passing the objective function, goal type (in this case, `MINIMIZE`), and an initial guess.\n4. During the optimization process, the `iterateSimplex` method is called in a loop to iteratively update the simplex.\n5. Inside the `iterateSimplex` method, the original simplex is saved and the best point is extracted.\n6. A reflection step is performed by evaluating a new simplex using the `evaluateNewSimplex` method with a reflection coefficient of 1.0.\n7. If the reflected simplex is better than the best point, an expanded simplex is computed and accepted if it is better than the reflected simplex.\n8. If the reflected simplex is not better than the best point, a contracted simplex is computed and accepted if it is better than the best point.\n9.
