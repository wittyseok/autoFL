It then creates a `comment` string containing the value `@preserve Foo\\nBar\\n\\nBaz*/`. The test calls the `parse` method with the `comment` string.\n\nThe failed assertion is on line 1278, where it compares the expected value `\" Foo\\nBar\\n\\nBaz\"` with the actual value returned by `node.getJSDocInfo().getLicense()`. The expected value has a newline character after `\"Bar\"`, while the actual value has a space character after `\"Bar\"`.\n\nNow let's determine the potential locations where the bug could be in the source code.\nBased on the information provided, the potential locations where the bug could be in the source code are:\n\n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.JsDocInfoParser.parse(String comment)`\n\nPlease note that these are only potential locations and further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact cause of the bug."

The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
