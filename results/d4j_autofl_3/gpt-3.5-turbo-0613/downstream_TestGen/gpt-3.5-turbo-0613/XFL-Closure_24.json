This input is similar to the original failing test and should reproduce the bug.\n\nIn `testSimilarButPasses()`, the test input is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, but instead of using single quotes to enclose the string, it uses double quotes. This should not trigger the bug and the test is expected to pass."
