This test will trigger the bug and fail, as the expected output (`var obj = {\\\"key\\\":123};`) does not match the actual output (`var obj={\\\"key\\\":123};`).\n\nIn `testSimilarButPasses()`, the test code is almost identical to `testReproducesBug()`, except for the expected output. In this test, the expected output (`var obj = {\\\"key\\\":123};`) matches the actual output (`var obj = {\\\"key\\\":123};`). As a result, this test will pass and does not trigger the bug."
