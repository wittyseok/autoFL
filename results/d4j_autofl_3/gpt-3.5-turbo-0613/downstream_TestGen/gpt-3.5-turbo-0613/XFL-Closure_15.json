Finally, it calls the `noInline` method with the JavaScript code snippet `\"var a,b,x = a in b; delete a[b]; x\"`. The error occurred at line 68 of the test.\n\nBy examining the code snippets for the `inline` and `noInline` methods, it appears that both methods simply call the `test` method with the provided input code and expected code. However, there are no JavaDoc comments available for these methods to provide further insight.\n\nAs the error occurred at line 68 when calling the `noInline` method, we can investigate the implementation of the `noInline` method to determine the cause of the error.

It concatenates the input and expected code with the prefix `\"function _func() {\"` and the suffix `\"}\"`. \n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that the error occurred when calling the `noInline` method, which in turn called the `inline` method.
