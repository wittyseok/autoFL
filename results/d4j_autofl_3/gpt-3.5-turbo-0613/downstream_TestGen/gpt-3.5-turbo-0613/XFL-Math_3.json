Since the test uses a single-element array for both `a` and `b`, the `prodHigh` array only has one element, which is at index 0. Therefore, attempting to access index 1 of the `prodHigh` array causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the `linearCombination` method to handle the case when `a` and `b` have different lengths. One possible solution would be to check if `len` is less than or equal to 1, and if so, return the product of the first elements of `a` and `b`. This would handle the case of single-element arrays correctly.\norg.apache.commons.math3.util.MathArrays.linearCombination(double\\[\\], double\\[])"

The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
