This test checks whether cloning a `NormalDistribution` object produces a clone that still produces the same samples as the original distribution. The test failure indicates that the samples produced by the original distribution and its clone are not equal.\n\nLooking at the code snippet for the `sample` method of `NormalDistribution`, we can see that the samples are generated by multiplying the standard deviation by a random number from a Gaussian distribution and adding the mean (`standardDeviation * random.nextGaussian() + mean`). This means that the samples will vary around the mean value.\n\nThe test constructs a `NormalDistribution` object, sets its internal random generator seed, and generates a sample from the distribution. Then, it clones the distribution and generates a sample from the clone. The test asserts that the two samples should be equal.\n\nThe error occurred at line 394 in the test code, where the assert statement `Assert.assertEquals(s1, s2, 0d)` failed. The expected value was `3.176024051402272`, but the actual value was `0.6542132477988758`.\n\nTo understand why the samples are not equal, we need to examine how the distribution is initialized and cloned. Looking at the code snippets for the constructors of `NormalDistribution`, we can see that there are multiple constructors, each with different parameters. The constructors set the mean, standard deviation, and other properties of the distribution.\n\nIn this case, the `NormalDistribution` object is initialized with the constructor `NormalDistribution(double, double)`, which takes the mean and standard deviation as parameters. The mean and standard deviation values are provided as arguments to the constructor.\n\nWhen the distribution is cloned in the `testDistributionClone` method, the `deepClone` method is called, which creates a deep copy of the distribution object.\n\nBased on the information we have so far, it seems that the difference in the samples might be due to a difference in the mean and standard deviation values between the original distribution and its clone.\n\nNext, we can examine the code for the constructors of `NormalDistribution` to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nThe constructor `NormalDistribution(double, double)` initializes the mean and standard deviation properties of the distribution. It throws a `NotStrictlyPositiveException` if the standard deviation is not positive.\n\nThe constructor `NormalDistribution(RandomGenerator, double, double, double)` is also available, which takes a random generator, mean, standard deviation, and inverse cumulative distribution function accuracy as parameters. This constructor ultimately calls the `super(rng)` constructor of the `AbstractRealDistribution` class.\n\nBased on the code snippets we have seen, it seems unlikely that the difference in the samples is due to a difference in the mean and standard deviation values. However, it is still possible that the random generator used by the original distribution and its clone produces different random numbers, leading to different samples.\n\nTo investigate the random number generation further, we would need to examine the code for the random generators used by the `NormalDistribution` class.\n\nSuggested locations to fix:\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.sample()`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(double, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(org.apache.commons.math3.random.RandomGenerator, double, double, double)`\n\nPlease note that further analysis is required to pinpoint the exact location of the bug.\nBased on the analysis, the bug could potentially be located in the following methods:\n\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.sample()`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(double, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(org.apache.commons.math3.random.RandomGenerator, double, double, double)`\n\nThese methods are involved in the generation of the samples and the initialization of the `NormalDistribution` object.

Looking at the code snippets for the constructors of `NormalDistribution`, we can see that there are multiple constructors, each with different parameters. The constructors set the mean, standard deviation, and other properties of the distribution.\n\nIn this case, the `NormalDistribution` object is initialized with the constructor `NormalDistribution(double, double)`, which takes the mean and standard deviation as parameters. The mean and standard deviation values are provided as arguments to the constructor.\n\nWhen the distribution is cloned in the `testDistributionClone` method, the `deepClone` method is called, which creates a deep copy of the distribution object.\n\nBased on the information we have so far, it seems that the difference in the samples might be due to a difference in the mean and standard deviation values between the original distribution and its clone.\n\nNext, we can examine the code for the constructors of `NormalDistribution` to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nThe constructor `NormalDistribution(double, double)` initializes the mean and standard deviation properties of the distribution. It throws a `NotStrictlyPositiveException` if the standard deviation is not positive.\n\nThe constructor `NormalDistribution(RandomGenerator, double, double, double)` is also available, which takes a random generator, mean, standard deviation, and inverse cumulative distribution function accuracy as parameters. This constructor ultimately calls the `super(rng)` constructor of the `AbstractRealDistribution` class.\n\nBased on the code snippets we have seen, it seems unlikely that the difference in the samples is due to a difference in the mean and standard deviation values. However, it is still possible that the random generator used by the original distribution and its clone produces different random numbers, leading to different samples.\n\nTo investigate the random number generation further, we would need to examine the code for the random generators used by the `NormalDistribution` class.\n\nSuggested locations to fix:\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.sample()`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(double, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(org.apache.commons.math3.random.RandomGenerator, double, double, double)`\n\nPlease note that further analysis is required to pinpoint the exact location of the bug.\nBased on the analysis, the bug could potentially be located in the following methods:\n\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.sample()`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(double, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution.NormalDistribution(org.apache.commons.math3.random.RandomGenerator, double, double, double)`\n\nThese methods are involved in the generation of the samples and the initialization of the `NormalDistribution` object. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact source of the bug."
