However, the test failure indicates that the `getOutlinePaint` method is returning an unexpected value. \n\nBased on the code snippet of the `ValueMarker.ValueMarker` method, we can see that the `outlinePaint` parameter is assigned to both the paint and outline paint of the marker. This means that the outline paint is the same as the main paint. \n\nTo confirm this, we can check the documentation for the `ValueMarker.ValueMarker` method. According to the documentation, the `outlinePaint` parameter is permitted to be null, which suggests that if it is null, the outline paint should be the same as the main paint.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that the test is expecting the outline paint to be `Color.blue`, but it is actually `Color.red`, which is the same as the main paint. Therefore, the test fails because the expected and actual values don't match.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the `ValueMarker.ValueMarker` method to handle the case when the `outlinePaint` parameter is null and assign the main paint color to the outline paint.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Modify the `ValueMarker.ValueMarker` method in the `org.jfree.chart.plot.ValueMarker` class to handle the case when the `outlinePaint` parameter is null and assign the main paint color to the outline paint.\n\nCode snippet:\n```\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Stroke stroke, \n                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {\n    super(paint, stroke, (outlinePaint != null ? outlinePaint : paint), outlineStroke, alpha);\n    this.value = value;\n}\n```\n\nNote: This fix assumes that it is desirable for the outline paint to be the same as the main paint when the `outlinePaint` parameter is null. If this is not the intended behavior, then further investigation is needed to determine the correct fix."
