However, we can still gather useful information by examining the code snippet we retrieved earlier.\n\nIn the `testDrawWithNullInfo` method, the test is attempting to draw a chart using a `Graphics2D` object (`g2`) and a `Rectangle2D.Double` object (`new Rectangle2D.Double(0, 0, 200, 100)`). However, it is unclear what `this.chart` represents in this context.\n\nSince we don't have access to the covered methods for the `GanttChartTests` class, let's try to understand the root cause by analyzing the error message and call stack. \n\nThe error message states:\n\n```\njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError\n\tat org.jfree.chart.junit.GanttChartTests.testDrawWithNullInfo(GanttChartTests.java:124)\n```\n\nThis error message indicates that an `AssertionFailedError` occurred in the `testDrawWithNullInfo` method of the `GanttChartTests` class at line 124.\n\nBased on this information, let's suggest the best location to fix the bug:\n\n`org.jfree.chart.junit.GanttChartTests.testDrawWithNullInfo()`"

The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
