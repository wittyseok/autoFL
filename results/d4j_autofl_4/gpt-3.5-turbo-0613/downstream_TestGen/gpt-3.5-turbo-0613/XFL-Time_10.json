The test calls the `Months.monthsBetween` method from the `org.joda.time.Months` class with two `MonthDay` instances as arguments. The test expects the method to return the number of months between the two `MonthDay` instances. However, the test fails with an `IllegalFieldValueException`, indicating that the value of `29` for `dayOfMonth` is not valid.\n\nBy inspecting the code of `Months.monthsBetween`, we can see that it is using the `Between` method from the `BaseSingleFieldPeriod` class to calculate the difference between the start and end `ReadablePartial` objects. This method eventually calls the `set` method of the `PreciseDurationDateTimeField` class. In this `set` method, the `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds` method is called to check if the value is within the specified bounds.\n\nThe `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds` method throws an `IllegalFieldValueException` if the value is not within the specified bounds. In this case, the method expects the `dayOfMonth` value to be in the range of `[1, 28]` but receives `29`, which leads to the exception being thrown.\n\nTo fix this issue, the code in the `Months.monthsBetween` method should handle cases where the `dayOfMonth` value exceeds the range of `[1, 28]`, and adjust the months calculation accordingly.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Class: `org.joda.time.Months`\n  Method: `monthsBetween(ReadablePartial start, ReadablePartial end)`\n  Signature: `org.joda.time.Months.monthsBetween(org.joda.time.ReadablePartial, org.joda.time.ReadablePartial)`\n\n- Class: `org.joda.time.field.PreciseDurationDateTimeField`\n  Method: `set(long instant, int value)`\n  Signature: `org.joda.time.field.PreciseDurationDateTimeField.set(long, int)`"
