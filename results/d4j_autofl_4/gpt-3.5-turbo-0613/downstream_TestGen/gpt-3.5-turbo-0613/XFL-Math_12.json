It uses different algorithms depending on the value of the `shape` parameter.\n\nFor `shape` < 1, the algorithm used is based on the Ahrens-Dieter method, as described in the comments and implemented in lines 373-409 of the code snippet.\n\nFor `shape` >= 1, the algorithm used is based on the Marsaglia-Tsang method, also mentioned in the comments and implemented in lines 411-435 of the code snippet.\n\nBased on this information, let's analyze the failure in more detail.\nThe test failure occurred in the line `Assert.assertEquals(s1, s2, 0d)` of the `testDistributionClone` method in the `GammaDistributionTest` class. The test expected the sample generated by the original distribution (`s1`) to be equal to the sample generated by the cloned distribution (`s2`), with a tolerance of 0.\n\nTo understand why the samples are not equal, we need to examine the implementation of the `sample` method in the `GammaDistribution` class.\n\nThe `sample` method uses different algorithms depending on the value of the `shape` parameter. In this case, we can see that the `shape` parameter is not specified explicitly in the test code, so it may have a default value.\n\nLooking at the code of the `sample` method, we can see that it generates random samples from the gamma distribution by applying specific algorithms. Without further information about the specific values of the `shape`, `scale`, and `random` parameters used in the test, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the failure.\n\nHowever, we can speculate that the difference in the sample values (`s1` and `s2`) may be due to the nature of random number generation, as well as the algorithms used in the `sample` method. It is possible that the slight variation in the random number generation process or the different algorithms used for generating samples in the original distribution and the cloned distribution could result in different sample values.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, we would need to gather more information about the specific input parameters used in the test and the behavior of the random number generation process in the `sample` method."
