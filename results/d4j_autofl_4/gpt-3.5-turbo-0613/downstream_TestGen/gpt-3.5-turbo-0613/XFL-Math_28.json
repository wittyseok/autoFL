Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

It checks if the tableau contains artificial variables, and then performs iterations until the tableau becomes optimal. If the entry in the first row of the right-hand side column of the tableau is not zero, it throws a `NoFeasibleSolutionException`.\n\nHere is the code snippet for the `solvePhase1()` method:\n```java\n194 :     protected void solvePhase1(final SimplexTableau tableau)\n195 :         throws MaxCountExceededException, UnboundedSolutionException, NoFeasibleSolutionException {\n\n197 :         if (tableau.getNumArtificialVariables() == 0) {\n198 :             return;\n199 :         }\n\n201 :         while (!tableau.isOptimal()) {\n202 :             doIteration(tableau);\n203 :         }\n\n205 :         if (!Precision.equals(tableau.getEntry(0, tableau.getRhsOffset()), 0d, epsilon)) {\n206 :             throw new NoFeasibleSolutionException();\n207 :         }\n209 :     }\n```\n\nThe `doIteration()` method in the `org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.linear.SimplexSolver` class performs one iteration of the simplex algorithm. It increments the iterations counter, finds the pivot column and pivot row, and then updates the tableau by dividing the pivot row by the pivot element and subtracting the pivot row multiplied by the pivot element from the other rows in the tableau.\n\nHere is the code snippet for the `doIteration()` method:\n```java\n163 :     protected void doIteration(final SimplexTableau tableau)\n164 :         throws MaxCount"
