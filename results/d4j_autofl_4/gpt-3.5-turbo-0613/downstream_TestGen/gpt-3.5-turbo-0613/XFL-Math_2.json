However, the assertion at line 297 failed with the error message \"sample=-49\".\n\nTo understand how this error occurred, let's examine the `HypergeometricDistribution` class and its constructor. The failing test creates a `HypergeometricDistribution` instance using the constructor `HypergeometricDistribution(int populationSize, int numberOfSuccesses, int sampleSize)`.\n\nThe constructor documentation indicates that it initializes a new hypergeometric distribution with the specified population size, number of successes in the population, and sample size. It also specifies that it throws exceptions if the input values are invalid, such as `NotPositiveException` if `numberOfSuccesses` is less than zero, `NotStrictlyPositiveException` if `populationSize` is less than or equal to zero, and `NumberIsTooLargeException` if `numberOfSuccesses` is greater than `populationSize` or `sampleSize` is greater than `populationSize`.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have access to the code implementation of the `HypergeometricDistribution` class. Therefore, we cannot determine if there is a bug in the constructor or elsewhere in the class that could lead to the assertion failure in the test. However, based on the error message \"sample=-49\", it seems that a negative value is being generated by the `sample()` method, which is unexpected and led to the assertion failure.\n\nTo further investigate this issue, we would need to analyze the implementation of the `sample()` method in the `HypergeometricDistribution` class and its dependencies. However, since we do not have access to the code, we cannot provide a more detailed analysis.\n\nSuggestions for fixes:\n- Examine the implementation of the `sample()` method in the `HypergeometricDistribution` class and ensure it generates valid samples within the expected range.\n- Verify that the input values provided to the `HypergeometricDistribution` constructor are correct and satisfy the required conditions to avoid any unexpected behavior.\n\nNote: Without access to the code implementation, it is challenging to provide a precise diagnosis of the issue."

                "content": "Title: Diagnosis of test `testMath1021`\nDetails: The test `testMath1021` in the class `HypergeometricDistributionTest` failed because it encountered an assertion failure at line 297. \n\nLooking at the test code, it is checking the correctness of the `sample()` method by generating 100 samples from a `HypergeometricDistribution` instance and ensuring that each sample is within the expected range. However, the assertion at line 297 failed with the error message \"sample=-49\".\n\nTo understand how this error occurred, let's examine the `HypergeometricDistribution` class and its constructor. The failing test creates a `HypergeometricDistribution` instance using the constructor `HypergeometricDistribution(int populationSize, int numberOfSuccesses, int sampleSize)`.\n\nThe constructor documentation indicates that it initializes a new hypergeometric distribution with the specified population size, number of successes in the population, and sample size. It also specifies that it throws exceptions if the input values are invalid, such as `NotPositiveException` if `numberOfSuccesses` is less than zero, `NotStrictlyPositiveException` if `populationSize` is less than or equal to zero, and `NumberIsTooLargeException` if `numberOfSuccesses` is greater than `populationSize` or `sampleSize` is greater than `populationSize`.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have access to the code implementation of the `HypergeometricDistribution` class. Therefore, we cannot determine if there is a bug in the constructor or elsewhere in the class that could lead to the assertion failure in the test. However, based on the error message \"sample=-49\", it seems that a negative value is being generated by the `sample()` method, which is unexpected and led to the assertion failure.\n\nTo further investigate this issue, we would need to analyze the implementation of the `sample()` method in the `HypergeometricDistribution` class and its dependencies. However, since we do not have access to the code, we cannot provide a more detailed analysis.\n\nSuggestions for fixes:\n- Examine the implementation of the `sample()` method in the `HypergeometricDistribution` class and ensure it generates valid samples within the expected range.\n- Verify that the input values provided to the `HypergeometricDistribution` constructor are correct and satisfy the required conditions to avoid any unexpected behavior.\n\nNote: Without access to the code implementation, it is challenging to provide a precise diagnosis of the issue."
