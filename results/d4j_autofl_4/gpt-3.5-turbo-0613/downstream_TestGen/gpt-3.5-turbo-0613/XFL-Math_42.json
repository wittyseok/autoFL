Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The `solvePhase1` method is then called to perform the phase 1 of the simplex algorithm, and the `dropPhase1Objective` method is called to remove the phase 1 objective.\n\nA loop is executed while the tableau is not optimal. In each iteration, the `doIteration` method is called, which performs a single iteration of the simplex algorithm.\n\nWhen the tableau becomes optimal, the solution is obtained from the tableau using the `getSolution` method, and a `RealPointValuePair` object is returned.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that the issue causing the test failure might be related to the linear optimization problem setup and the simplex algorithm's behavior. It's possible that the particular problem being solved in the `testMath713NegativeVariable` test case does not have a feasible solution or the algorithm is not finding the expected solution"
