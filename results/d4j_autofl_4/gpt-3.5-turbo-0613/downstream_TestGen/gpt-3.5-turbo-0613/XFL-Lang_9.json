It calls the method `testSdfAndFdp` with the arguments `\"'d'd'\"`, `\"d3\"`, and `true`. The test is expecting an exception to be thrown, but it did not occur, causing the test to fail. \n\nLooking at the source code of the `FastDateParser` class, we can see that the `parse` method is responsible for parsing a string into a `Date` object. If the parsing fails, an exception is thrown. \n\nTo investigate further, let's examine the `testSdfAndFdp` method from the `FastDateParserTest` class. This method compares the behavior of the `SimpleDateFormat` class (`sdf`) and the `FastDateParser` class (`fdp`) when parsing dates. If both parsers succeed or both fail in parsing the input date, the test passes. Otherwise, if one parser succeeds and the other fails, the test fails with an appropriate error message.\n\nIn this case, the `FastDateParser` is expected to fail when parsing the input date `'d3'` with the format `\"'d'd'\"`. However, the parsing succeeds without throwing an exception, causing the test to fail. \n\nBased on this information, it appears that there might be an issue with the parsing logic in the `FastDateParser` class, specifically related to handling single quoted characters within the format string.\n\nTo fix the issue in the `FastDateParser` class, we can modify the `parse` method to properly handle single quoted characters in the format string and throw an exception if the parsing fails.\n\nSuggested method to fix:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.parse(java.lang.String)`"
