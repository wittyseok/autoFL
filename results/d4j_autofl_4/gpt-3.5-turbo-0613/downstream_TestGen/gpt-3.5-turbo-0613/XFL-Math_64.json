However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

Then, it iterates over each element of the `theoreticalMinParams` array and compares it with the corresponding element in the `params` array obtained from the `optimum` vectorial point. The comparison is done with a certain accuracy threshold, defined by `paramsAccuracy * (1.0 + Math.abs(mi))`. If any of the values do not match within the threshold, an assertion error will be thrown.\n\nBased on the error message and call stack provided in the test failure, the assertion failure occurred when comparing the expected value `11.41300466147456` with the actual value `11.4121122022341`. This suggests that the actual value is slightly different from the expected value, leading to the test failure.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to investigate why the actual value is not matching the expected value in the `checkTheoreticalMinParams` method.
