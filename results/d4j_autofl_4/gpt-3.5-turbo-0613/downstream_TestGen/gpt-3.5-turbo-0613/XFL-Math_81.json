Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

Other classes in this package that are covered by failing tests include `ArrayRealVector`, `AbstractRealMatrix`, `Array2DRowRealMatrix`, `MatrixUtils`, `RealVectorFormat`, and `DefaultRealMatrixPreservingVisitor`.\nThe test `org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImplTest.testMath308()` failed with an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at line 1544 of the `EigenDecompositionImpl` class. Let's examine the code snippet at that line.\n\n```java\n1542: int j = fastEigenvalue ? n - 2 : j2 + mu;\n1543: if (fastEigenvalue) {\n1544:     while (j >= 0 && e[j] < splitTolerance) {\n1545:         // real root found\n1546:         computeRootEigenvector(j);\n1547:         j--;\n1548:     }\n1549: } else {\n1550:     while (j >= currentSplit && e[j] < splitTolerance) {\n1551:         // second root of a pair found\n1552:         computeRootEigenvectors(j);\n1553:         mu += 2;\n1554:         j--;\n1555:     }\n1556: }\n```\n\nLooking at the code, the error occurs because the value of `j` becomes `-1` in the while loop condition on line 1544. This results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when accessing `e[j]` on line 1545.\n\nTo identify the cause of this issue, we need to understand the variables and their values in this context.
