Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The test is calling the `solvePhase1` method of the `SimplexSolver` class to solve a linear optimization problem.\n\nTo investigate further, I retrieved the methods covered by failing tests for the `SimplexSolver` class. The relevant methods are:\n- `isOptimal(org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexTableau)`\n- `solvePhase1(org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexTableau)`\n- `doOptimize()`\n- `isPhase1Solved(org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexTableau)`\n- `SimplexSolver()`\n- `SimplexSolver(double)`\n- `getPivotColumn(org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexTableau)`\n- `getPivotRow(int, org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexTableau)`\n- `doIteration(org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexTableau)`\n\nLooking at the code snippet of the `SimplexSolver()` constructor, we can see that it is initializing the `SimplexSolver` object with a default epsilon value. There is no further information or logic in this constructor.\n\nTo diagnose the issue in the failing test, we need to explore the implementation of the `solvePhase1` method and other relevant methods. Please call the `get_code_snippet` function with the signature of the `solvePhase1` method (`org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexSolver.solvePhase1(org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexTableau)`)."
