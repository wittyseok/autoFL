Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "The failing test `testNotPositiveDefinite()` creates a `CholeskyDecomposition` object by passing a specific matrix to the constructor. The matrix used in the test is as follows:\n\n```java\nnew double[][] {\n    { 14, 11, 13, 15, 24 },\n    { 11, 34, 13, 8,  25 },\n    { 13, 13, 14, 15, 21 },\n    { 15, 8,  15, 18, 23 },\n    { 24, 25, 21, 23, 45 }\n}\n```\n\nThe expected behavior is that this matrix should throw a `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` when passed to the `CholeskyDecompositionImpl` constructor. However, the exception is not being thrown during the test execution, which indicates that there might be an issue with the implementation of the `CholeskyDecompositionImpl` class.\n\nTo fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code properly detects when the matrix is not positive definite and throws the `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` accordingly. This might involve checking for conditions such as negative eigenvalues or non-symmetric matrix properties.\n\nHere are the suggested methods to be fixed:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math.linear.CholeskyDecompositionImpl.CholeskyDecompositionImpl(org.apache.commons.math.linear.RealMatrix)\norg.apache.commons.math.linear.CholeskyDecompositionImpl.CholeskyDecompositionImpl(org.apache.commons.math.linear.RealMatrix, double, double)\n```"
