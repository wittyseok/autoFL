Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

It performs null checks on the compiler and safe name ID supplier parameters, and assigns them to corresponding instance variables. It also assigns the allowDecomposition parameter to the `allowDecomposition` instance variable.\n\nBased on the provided information, it seems that the issue with the duplicated label might be related to the usage of `FunctionInjector` within the `InlineFunctions` class. However, without further code inspection or analysis, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.\n\nTo fix the bug, you might consider investigating the usage of `FunctionInjector` and the logic around label handling within the `InlineFunctions` class. Additionally, verifying the correctness of the logic for inline function handling within the `InlineFunctions` class could also be beneficial.\n\nHere are the methods that could potentially be fixed:\n```\ncom.google.javascript.jscomp.InlineFunctions.InlineFunctions(AbstractCompiler, com.google.common.base.Supplier, boolean, boolean, boolean)\ncom.google.javascript.jscomp.InlineFunctions.inlineGlobal(com.google.javascript.rhino.Node)\ncom.google.javascript.jscomp.InlineFunctions.inlineLocal(com.google.javascript.rhino.Node)\ncom.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionInjector.FunctionInjector(AbstractCompiler, com.google.common.base.Supplier, boolean)\n```"
