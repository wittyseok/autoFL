Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

It initializes the parent class `JSType` using the `super` keyword. Then it sets the `prettyPrint` flag to `true`.\n\nNext, it iterates over the keys in the `properties` map. For each key, it retrieves the corresponding `RecordProperty` from the map. If the property is null, it throws an `IllegalStateException`. Otherwise, it calls the `defineDeclaredProperty` method to define the property on the record type.\n\nFinally, it sets the `isFrozen` flag to `true`.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the issue might be related to how the `properties` map is constructed or how the `defineDeclaredProperty` method is used to define the properties on the record type.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information or if you would like me to investigate further."
