If these conditions are met, it retrieves the string value of the target node and returns it.\n\nBased on the failure message and the code snippets, it seems that the `extractClassNameIfGoog` method is not functioning correctly. It is expected to extract the class name from the `Node` that represents the target of the `goog.require` expression. However, it is returning the actual string value of the target node instead.\n\nTo fix this issue, the `extractClassNameIfGoog` method should retrieve the class name from the `Node` instead of returning the string value directly.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.extractClassNameIfGoog(com.google.javascript.rhino.Node, com.google.javascript.rhino.Node, java.lang.String)`\n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.extractClassNameIfRequire(com.google.javascript.rhino.Node, com.google.javascript.rhino.Node)`"
