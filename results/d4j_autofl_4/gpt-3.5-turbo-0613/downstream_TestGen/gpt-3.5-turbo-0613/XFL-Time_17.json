The first test, `testReproducesBug()`, should be a test that is different from the one that was initially presented to you, but should still reproduce the bug, based on your understanding of the bug. The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
