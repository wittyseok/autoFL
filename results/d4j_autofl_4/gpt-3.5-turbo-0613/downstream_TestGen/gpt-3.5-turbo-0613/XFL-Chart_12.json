That is why the assertion in the test fails.\n\nNext, we need to suggest some methods that could be fixed to address the bug.\nSuggested methods to fix the bug in `org.jfree.chart.plot.MultiplePiePlot`:\n\n1. `MultiplePiePlot(CategoryDataset)` - In this constructor, add code to register the `MultiplePiePlot` object as a listener with the `CategoryDataset` parameter.\n\n2. `getDataset()` - In this getter method, ensure that the `MultiplePiePlot` object is registered as a listener with the dataset before returning it.\n\n3. Other relevant methods related to registering and unregistering listeners in the `MultiplePiePlot` class could also be examined and modified if necessary.\n\nNote that the exact implementation details would depend on the requirements and design of the `MultiplePiePlot` class."
