It also mentions that an `OutOfRangeException` will be thrown if the elitism rate is outside the range of [0, 1].\n\nBased on the test failure and the information gathered so far, it seems that the test is expecting an `OutOfRangeException` to be thrown when the elitism rate is set to a value greater than 1. Let's confirm this by examining the test code and the expected exception in the test.\n\nThe failing test asserts that an `OutOfRangeException` is expected to be thrown. Let's take a look at the test code:\n\n```java\n85 :     @Test(expected = OutOfRangeException.class)\n86 :     public void testChromosomeListConstructorTooHigh() {\n87 :         final List<Chromosome> chromosomes = Collections.emptyList();\n88 :         final double rate = 1.25;\n89 :         new ElitisticListPopulation(chromosomes, 100, rate);\n90 :     }\n```\n\nThe test creates an empty list of chromosomes, sets the elitism rate to `1.25`, and calls the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor with these arguments. The `@Test` annotation specifies that an `OutOfRangeException` is expected to be thrown.\n\nSince the test is expecting an `OutOfRangeException` to be thrown, but the exception is not being thrown, it suggests that there might be an issue with the validation of the elitism rate within the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can modify the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor to validate the elitism rate and throw an `OutOfRangeException` if it is outside the range of [0, 1]. We should add a check for the elitism rate and throw the `OutOfRangeException` accordingly.\n\nSuggested fix:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ElitisticListPopulation.ElitisticListPopulation(java.util.List<org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.Chromosome>, int, double)\n```\n\nIn this fix, we modify the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor to include an additional validation check for the elitism rate and throw an `OutOfRangeException` if it is outside the [0, 1] range.\n\nNote: The fix assumes that the `ElitisticListPopulation` class is the correct location to handle the validation and throw the exception. If the validation should be handled elsewhere, the suggested fix may need to be adjusted accordingly."
