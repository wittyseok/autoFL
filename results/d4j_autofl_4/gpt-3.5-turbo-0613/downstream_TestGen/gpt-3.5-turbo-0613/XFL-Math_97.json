Consequently, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that the endpoints do not have different signs.\n\nTo fix the bug, the code within the `if (sign >= 0)` block needs to be modified to handle cases where the function values at the endpoints have the same sign.\n\nSuggested fix:\n```\norg.apache.commons.math.analysis.BrentSolver.solve(double, double)\n```"

Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is.

This class belongs to the `org.apache.commons.math.analysis` package. The test calls the `solve` method of the `BrentSolver` class.\n\nThe code snippet for the `solve` method in `BrentSolver` is as follows:\n\n```java\n125 :     public double solve(double min, double max) throws MaxIterationsExceededException,\n126 :         FunctionEvaluationException {\n\n128 :         clearResult();\n129 :         verifyInterval(min, max);\n\n131 :         double ret = Double.NaN;\n\n133 :         double yMin = f.value(min);\n134 :         double yMax = f.value(max);\n\n137 :         double sign = yMin * yMax;\n138 :         if (sign >= 0) {\n141 :             throw new IllegalArgumentException\n142 :             (\"Function values at endpoints do not have different signs.\" +\n143 :                     \"  Endpoints: [\" + min + \",\" + max + \"]\" +\n144 :                     \"  Values: [\" + yMin + \",\" + yMax + \"]\");\n145 :         } else {\n147 :             ret = solve(min, yMin, max, yMax, min, yMin);\n149 :         }\n\n151 :         return ret;\n152 :     }\n```\n\nThe error message indicates that the function values at the endpoints do not have different signs.

However, in this scenario, the product of `yMin` and `yMax` is not less than 0, which means that the signs of the function values are the same. Consequently, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that the endpoints do not have different signs.\n\nTo fix the bug, the code within the `if (sign >= 0)` block needs to be modified to handle cases where the function values at the endpoints have the same sign.\n\nSuggested fix:\n```\norg.apache.commons.math.analysis.BrentSolver.solve(double, double)\n```"
