Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

It takes several parameters, including `code`, `expectedResult`, `fnName`, `mode`, and `decompose`. \n\nBased on the provided code snippet, the `helperInlineReferenceToFunction` method initializes a `Compiler` and a `FunctionInjector` instance. It then parses the input code and obtains the root node of the parse tree. The method searches for the specified function node in the tree and performs various operations using the `FunctionInjector` object. Finally, it compares the generated code with the expected result and asserts their equality.\n\nTo further investigate the cause of the failure, we need to examine the implementation of the `FunctionInjector` class. However, the code snippet does not provide the implementation for the `FunctionInjector` class. Please provide the code snippet for the `FunctionInjector` class if available."
