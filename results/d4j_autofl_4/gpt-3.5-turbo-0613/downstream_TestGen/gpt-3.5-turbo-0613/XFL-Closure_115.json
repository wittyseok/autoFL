The first test, `testReproducesBug()`, should be a test that is different from the one that was initially presented to you, but should still reproduce the bug, based on your understanding of the bug. The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug. Please answer in the format:\n\n```java\npublic void testReproducesBug() {\n    (failing test content)\n}\n\npublic void testSimilarButPasses() {\n    (passing test content)\n}\n```\n\nYour answer will be processed automatically, so do not include any commentary.
