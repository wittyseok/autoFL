Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This test is trying to parse a date string \"2 29\" into a `MutableDateTime` object. However, the parsing fails with the error message \"Value 29 for dayOfMonth must be in the range [1,28]\".\n\nBy analyzing the code of the `DateTimeFormatter.parseInto` method, we can see that it first checks if the `instant` parameter is null and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. Then, it retrieves the current millisecond value from the `instant` and the associated `Chronology`. It also computes the local millisecond value by adding the current millisecond value with the offset of the timezone.\n\nNext, it creates a `DateTimeParserBucket` object to hold the parsed values and initializes it with the local millisecond value, the `Chronology`, the locale, the pivot year, and the default year. It then calls the `parseInto` method of the `DateTimeParser` object with the `DateTimeParserBucket`, the input text, and the starting position.\n\nAfter parsing, it retrieves the computed millisecond value from the `DateTimeParserBucket` and sets it in the `instant`. If an offset was parsed and found in the `DateTimeParserBucket`, it adjusts the `Chronology` of the `instant` to the parsed offset. If a timezone was parsed and found in the `DateTimeParserBucket`, it sets the `Chronology` of the `instant` to the parsed timezone.\n\nFinally, it sets the `Chronology` and the timezone of the `instant` if they were explicitly set in the `DateTimeFormatter`. It returns the new position after parsing.\n\nBased on the error message and the code analysis, it seems that the parsing of the day of the month fails because the value of \"29\" is not within the range [1,28] for February. This implies that there is a problem with the parsing mechanism for the day of the month, leading to the incorrect validation of the value.\n\nTo fix this issue, the code in the `DateTimeFormatter.parseInto` method should be modified to correctly handle the parsing of the day of the month.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Update the parsing mechanism for the day of the month to properly validate the value within the range of the corresponding month.\n\nAlternative fix:\n- Modify the `DateTimeParser` object used in the `DateTimeFormatter.parseInto` method to handle the parsing of the day of the month correctly.\n\nAnother suggested fix:\n- Improve the error message produced when the parsing fails to provide more specific information about the invalid value and the expected range.\n\nPossible method to be fixed:\n- `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.parseInto(org.joda.time.ReadWritableInstant, java.lang.String, int)`"
