Each test case calls the `test` method with two JavaScript code snippets: the input code and the expected collapsed code. \n\nFrom the code snippet, it is clear that the `test` method is responsible for collapsing the variable declarations. This method takes two string arguments: the input code and the expected output code.\n\nNow that we have examined the code snippets, we can conclude that the main issue is likely in the implementation of the `test` method, which is responsible for collapsing variable declarations. The `testIssue820` method is utilizing this `test` method, and it seems that the collapsing of variable declarations is not working as expected.\n\nTo fix the issue, we should focus on the `test` method and ensure that it correctly collapses variable declarations without redeclaring the variables. However, without access to the implementation of the `test` method, it is difficult to provide a specific fix.\n\nTherefore, the suggested location to be fixed is:\n\n```\ncom.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarationsTest.test(String, String)\n```"
