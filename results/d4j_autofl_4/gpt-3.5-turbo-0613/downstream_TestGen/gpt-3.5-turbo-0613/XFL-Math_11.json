Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

It subtracts the mean values obtained from the `getMeans` method from the input `values`, and then performs computations using the covariance matrix inverse.\n\nThe code snippet for the `getMeans` method in the `MultivariateNormalDistribution` class is as follows:\n\n```java\n163 :     public double[] getMeans() {\n164 :         return MathArrays.copyOf(means);\n165 :     }\n```\n\nThe `getMeans` method simply returns a copy of the mean values used in the distribution.\n\nBased on the code snippets, the failure might be caused by incorrect calculation of the mean values (`getMeans`), or errors in the computation of the `exponent` term (`getExponentTerm`). To further diagnose the issue, we should examine the test data and ensure that the input values and mean values are as expected.\n\nSince the code snippets do not reveal any obvious issues, it would be beneficial to examine the implementation of the `MultivariateNormalDistribution` class and verify if the covariance matrix, mean values, and other relevant variables are set correctly.\n\nTo address the failure in the `testUnivariateDistribution` method, the following methods in the `MultivariateNormalDistribution` class could potentially be fixed:\n\n- `density(double[])`\n- `getExponentTerm(double[])`\n- `getMeans()`\n\nThese methods should be carefully reviewed and debugged to determine if any issues exist that are causing the failure in the test."
