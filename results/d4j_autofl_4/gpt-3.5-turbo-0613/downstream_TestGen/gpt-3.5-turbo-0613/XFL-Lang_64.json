However, the test throws a `ClassCastException` at line 108 because it expects a `ClassCastException` to be thrown when comparing enum instances of different types.\n\nBy inspecting the `compareTo` method of the `ValuedEnum` class, we can see that it compares the values of two `ValuedEnum` instances by subtracting their `iValue` fields. This suggests that the `iValue` field is expected to be present in both `ValuedEnum` instances being compared.\n\nBased on the JavaDoc documentation for the `compareTo` method, it is mentioned that starting from version 2.2, the enums being compared must be of the same type. If the parameter is in a different class loader than this instance, reflection is used to compare the values. This information implies that the test failure is likely due to a mismatch in the enum types being compared.\n\nSuggested fixes:\n- One possible fix would be to modify the test to compare instances of the same enum type.\n- Another fix would be to handle the `ClassCastException` in the `testCompareTo_otherEnumType` method appropriately, depending on the expected behavior when comparing enum instances of different types.\n\nPossible fix locations:\n```\norg.apache.commons.lang.enums.ValuedEnum.compareTo(java.lang.Object)\norg.apache.commons.lang.enums.ValuedEnumTest.testCompareTo_otherEnumType()\n```"

The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug. Please answer in the format:\n\n```java\npublic void testReproducesBug() {\n    (failing test content)\n}\n\npublic void testSimilarButPasses() {\n    (passing test content)\n}\n```\n\nYour answer will be processed automatically, so do not include any commentary. Start your response with ```java"
