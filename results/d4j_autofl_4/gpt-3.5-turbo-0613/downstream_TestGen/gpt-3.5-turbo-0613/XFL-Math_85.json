If not, it throws an exception.\n\nThe method then creates a `UnivariateRealFunction` to calculate the difference between the cumulative probability and the input probability. It uses this function to perform root finding using bracketing and a default solver. The bracket is obtained using the `getDomainLowerBound` and `getDomainUpperBound` methods. If the bracketing fails to converge with a `ConvergenceException`, the method checks if the domain endpoints give a value within a certain accuracy. If so, it returns the respective endpoint. Otherwise, it throws a `MathException`.\n\nFinally, if the bracketing succeeds, the method performs root finding using the `UnivariateRealSolverUtils.solve` method and returns the root.\n\nBased on this code, it seems that the convergence issue mentioned in the error message could be due to the failure of bracket convergence. Further investigation is needed to understand the specific cause of the convergence exception and determine if any improvements can be made.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Further investigation is needed to identify the cause of the convergence exception in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n- Potential improvements to handle convergence issues could be made in the implementation of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in the `AbstractContinuousDistribution` class.\nBased on the analysis of the failing test `testMath280` and the information retrieved from the system under test, here is a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred:\n\n1. The test `testMath280` in the `NormalDistributionTest` class attempts to calculate the critical point `x` for a given probability `p` using the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class.\n\n2. The test sets up an instance of `NormalDistributionImpl` with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\n3. The test calls the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` instance with the probability value `0.9772498680518209`.\n\n4. The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class is expected to return the critical point `x` such that `P(X < x) = p`.\n\n5. However, during the execution of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, a `MathException` occurs, indicating a convergence issue.\n\n6. The call stack shows that the `ConvergenceException` is thrown within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class.\n\n7. To investigate the issue further, we examined the code snippet of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class and its superclass, `AbstractContinuousDistribution`.\n\n8. The code snippet of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in the `NormalDistributionImpl` class handles cases where the probability `p` is 0 or 1 correctly. It returns `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` for `p=0` and `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` for `p=1`. Otherwise, it calls the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the superclass.\n\n9. The code snippet of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in the `AbstractContinuousDistribution` class performs root finding using bracketing and a default solver. It attempts to find the root by finding the difference between the cumulative probability and the input probability. It utilizes the bracketing technique and checks if the domain endpoints give a value within a certain accuracy. If the bracketing fails to converge, it throws a `ConvergenceException`. If the bracketing succeeds, it performs root finding and returns the root.\n\nBased on the analysis, it seems that the bug in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method might be related to convergence issues during root finding. Further investigation is needed to identify the specific cause of the convergence exception and determine any necessary improvements to handle convergence issues in the implementation.\n\nSuggested fixes:\n- Improve the handling of convergence issues in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class.\n- Investigate and potentially enhance the root-finding implementation in the `AbstractContinuousDistribution` class.\n\nNote: The suggested fixes are based on the assumption that the convergence issue is the root cause of the test failure.

The test sets up an instance of `NormalDistributionImpl` with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\n3. The test calls the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` instance with the probability value `0.9772498680518209`.\n\n4. The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class is expected to return the critical point `x` such that `P(X < x) = p`.\n\n5. However, during the execution of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, a `MathException` occurs, indicating a convergence issue.\n\n6. The call stack shows that the `ConvergenceException` is thrown within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class.\n\n7. To investigate the issue further, we examined the code snippet of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class and its superclass, `AbstractContinuousDistribution`.\n\n8. The code snippet of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in the `NormalDistributionImpl` class handles cases where the probability `p` is 0 or 1 correctly. It returns `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` for `p=0` and `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` for `p=1`. Otherwise, it calls the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the superclass.\n\n9. The code snippet of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in the `AbstractContinuousDistribution` class performs root finding using bracketing and a default solver. It attempts to find the root by finding the difference between the cumulative probability and the input probability. It utilizes the bracketing technique and checks if the domain endpoints give a value within a certain accuracy. If the bracketing fails to converge, it throws a `ConvergenceException`. If the bracketing succeeds, it performs root finding and returns the root.\n\nBased on the analysis, it seems that the bug in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method might be related to convergence issues during root finding. Further investigation is needed to identify the specific cause of the convergence exception and determine any necessary improvements to handle convergence issues in the implementation.\n\nSuggested fixes:\n- Improve the handling of convergence issues in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class.\n- Investigate and potentially enhance the root-finding implementation in the `AbstractContinuousDistribution` class.\n\nNote: The suggested fixes are based on the assumption that the convergence issue is the root cause of the test failure. Further investigation and analysis may be needed to confirm and address the issue accurately."

Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."
