The comments also indicate that this method has been available since version 1.2 of the library.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the failed test is verifying that the `safeMultiply` method indeed throws an `ArithmeticException` when an overflow occurs. Now, let's analyze the test and the failure stack trace to understand why the test failed.\nThe test `testSafeMultiplyLongInt` in the class `org.joda.time.field.TestFieldUtils` is specifically checking if the `safeMultiply` method correctly throws an `ArithmeticException` when an overflow occurs. \n\nHowever, the test is failing at line 261 with the assertion `fail()`, indicating that the exception was not thrown as expected. \n\nTo further investigate this issue, let's take a closer look at the code snippet for the `safeMultiply` method and the test implementation."

The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
