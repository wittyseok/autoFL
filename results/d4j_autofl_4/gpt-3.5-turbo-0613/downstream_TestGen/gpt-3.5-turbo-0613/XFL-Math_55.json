                "content": "The test `org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DTest.testCrossProductCancellation()` failed. This test calls the method `Vector3D.crossProduct(Vector3D v1, Vector3D v2)` with two vectors as arguments. The expected result is (1.0, -2.0, 1.0), but the actual result is (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).\n\nLooking at the code snippet for the `crossProduct` method, we can see that it computes the cross product of two vectors using the formula `(v1.y * v2.z - v1.z * v2.y, v1.z * v2.x - v1.x * v2.z, v1.x * v2.y - v1.y * v2.x)`. This formula is correct for computing the cross product, so the bug is likely in the test or in the input vectors.\n\nNow, let's check the `checkVector` method that is called in the test.\n\nTo gather more information, please call the `get_code_snippet` function with the signature \"org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DTest.checkVector\"."

The first test, `testReproducesBug()`, should be a test that is different from the one that was initially presented to you, but should still reproduce the bug, based on your understanding of the bug. The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug. Please answer in the format:\n\n```java\npublic void testReproducesBug() {\n    (failing test content)\n}\n\npublic void testSimilarButPasses() {\n    (passing test content)\n}\n```\n\nYour answer will be processed automatically, so do not include any commentary.
