It then calls the `plusMonths` method on `test` with `-1` as the argument, which adds `-1` month to the `MonthDay`. The expected result is a `MonthDay` with the date of February 29th using the default instance of `ISOChronology`. Finally, the test asserts that the expected result is equal to the actual result.\n\nThe error occurred on line 476, where the test failed with the following error message:\n\n```\njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<--02-29> but was:<--02-28>\n\tat org.joda.time.TestMonthDay_Basics.testPlusMonths_int_negativeEndOfMonthAdjust(TestMonthDay_Basics.java:476)\n```\n\nThe test expected a `MonthDay` with the date of February 29th, but the actual result was a `MonthDay` with the date of February 28th.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that the `plusMonths` method in the `MonthDay` class is not adjusting the end of the month correctly when subtracting months.\n\nNow, I will provide suggestions on where the issue could be fixed in the code.\nBased on the information gathered, the issue seems to be with the `plusMonths` method of the `MonthDay` class in the `org.joda.time` package. To fix the bug, the implementation of the `plusMonths` method should be modified to correctly adjust the end of the month when subtracting months.\n\nThe method that needs to be fixed is:\n- `org.joda.time.MonthDay.plusMonths(int)`\n\nPlease note that I'm providing suggestions based on the code you provided, and there might be other factors to consider for a complete fix."
