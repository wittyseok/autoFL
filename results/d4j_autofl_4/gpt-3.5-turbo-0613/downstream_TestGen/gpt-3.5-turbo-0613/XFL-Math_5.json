The assertion in the failing test `Assert.assertEquals(Complex.ZERO.reciprocal(), Complex.INF)` expects the reciprocal of zero to be `Complex.INF`.\n\n4. However, the actual result of `Complex.ZERO.reciprocal()` is `(Infinity, Infinity)`.\n\n5. This means that the reciprocal of zero is not correctly handled in the `reciprocal()` method and is returning `(Infinity, Infinity)` instead of `Complex.INF` as expected.\n\nTo fix this bug, we should modify the `reciprocal()` method in the `Complex` class to correctly handle the reciprocal of zero.\nSuggested fix:\n- Modify the `reciprocal()` method in the `org.apache.commons.math3.complex.Complex` class to correctly handle the reciprocal of zero.\n\n```java\npublic Complex reciprocal() {\n    if (isNaN) {\n        return NaN;\n    }\n\n    if (real == 0.0 && imaginary == 0.0) {\n        // Handle the reciprocal of zero\n        return INF;\n    }\n\n    if (isInfinite) {\n        return ZERO;\n    }\n\n    if (FastMath.abs(real) < FastMath.abs(imaginary)) {\n        double q = real / imaginary;\n        double scale = 1. / (real * q + imaginary);\n        return createComplex(scale * q, -scale);\n    } else {\n        double q = imaginary / real;\n        double scale = 1. / (imaginary * q + real);\n        return createComplex(scale, -scale * q);\n    }\n}\n```"
