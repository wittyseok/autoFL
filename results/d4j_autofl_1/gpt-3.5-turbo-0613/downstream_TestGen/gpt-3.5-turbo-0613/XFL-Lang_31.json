Here is the documentation for the method:\n\n```\n<p>Checks if the CharSequence contains any character in the given set of characters.</p>\n\n<p>A <code>null</code> CharSequence will return <code>false</code>.\nA <code>null</code> or zero length search array will return <code>false</code>.</p>\n\n<pre>\nStringUtils.containsAny(null, *)                = false\nStringUtils.containsAny(\"\", *)                  = false\nStringUtils.containsAny(*, null)                = false\nStringUtils.containsAny(*, [])                  = false\nStringUtils.containsAny(\"zzabyycdxx\",['z','a']) = true\nStringUtils.containsAny(\"zzabyycdxx\",['b','y']) = true\nStringUtils.containsAny(\"aba\", ['z'])           = false\n</pre>\n\n@param cs  the CharSequence to check, may be null\n@param searchChars  the chars to search for, may be null\n@return the <code>true</code> if any of the chars are found,\n<code>false</code> if no match or null input\n@since 2.4\n```\n\nBased on the documentation, if the `cs` (the input `CharSequence`) is null or empty, or if the `searchChars` (the array of characters to search for) is null or empty, the method should return `false`. Otherwise, it will search for any character in `searchChars` within the `cs` and return `true` if any match is found.\n\nLet's continue our investigation by examining the failing assertion in the test.\nThe failing test `StringUtilsEqualsIndexOfTest.testContainsAnyCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` asserts that the `StringUtils.containsAny` method returns `false` when given the `CharU20000` character and an array containing the `CharU20001` character. \n\nBased on the code snippet and the documentation, if the `CharU20000` character is null or empty, or if the array containing the `CharU20001` character is null or empty, the method should return `false`.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, we need to find the values of the `CharU20000` and `CharU20001` variables. Let's search for their values in the code or test setup."
