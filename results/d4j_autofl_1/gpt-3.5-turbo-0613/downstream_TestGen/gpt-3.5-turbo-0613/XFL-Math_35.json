This test is part of the `org.apache.commons.math3.genetics` package, specifically the `ElitisticListPopulation` class. The failing test checks whether an `OutOfRangeException` is correctly thrown when the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor is called with a negative elitism rate.\n\nThe code snippet for the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor is as follows:\n\n```java\n47 : public ElitisticListPopulation(final List<Chromosome> chromosomes,\n48 :                                final int populationLimit,\n49 :                                final double elitismRate) {\n50 :     super(chromosomes, populationLimit);\n51 :     this.elitismRate = elitismRate;\n52 : }\n```\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor is not handling the case of a negative elitism rate properly, as the expected `OutOfRangeException` is not being thrown.\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor to properly handle the case of a negative elitism rate. One possible fix is to add a check for the elitism rate and throw an `OutOfRangeException` if it is negative.\n\nThe suggested fix is to modify the `ElitisticListPopulation` class as follows:\n\n```java\npublic class ElitisticListPopulation extends ListPopulation {\n    \n    private final double elitismRate;\n\n    public ElitisticListPopulation(final List<Chromosome> chromosomes,\n                                   final int populationLimit,\n                                   final double elitismRate) {\n        super(chromosomes, populationLimit);\n        \n        if (elitismRate < 0) {\n            throw new OutOfRangeException(elitismRate, 0, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY);\n        }\n        \n        this.elitismRate = elitismRate;\n    }\n    \n    // Rest of the class code...\n}\n```\n\nThis fix adds a check for a negative elitism rate and throws an `OutOfRangeException` if it is negative.\n\nAnother possible fix is to update the test case `ElitisticListPopulationTest.testChromosomeListConstructorTooLow()` to expect a different exception, such as `IllegalArgumentException`, instead of `OutOfRangeException`, if the elitism rate is negative. However, for consistency with the existing code, it is better to fix the constructor itself."

This test is part of the `org.apache.commons.math3.genetics` package, specifically the `ElitisticListPopulation` class. The failing test checks whether an `OutOfRangeException` is correctly thrown when the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor is called with a negative elitism rate.\n\nThe code snippet for the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor is as follows:\n\n```java\n47 : public ElitisticListPopulation(final List<Chromosome> chromosomes,\n48 :                                final int populationLimit,\n49 :                                final double elitismRate) {\n50 :     super(chromosomes, populationLimit);\n51 :     this.elitismRate = elitismRate;\n52 : }\n```\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor is not handling the case of a negative elitism rate properly, as the expected `OutOfRangeException` is not being thrown.\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor to properly handle the case of a negative elitism rate. One possible fix is to add a check for the elitism rate and throw an `OutOfRangeException` if it is negative.\n\nThe suggested fix is to modify the `ElitisticListPopulation` class as follows:\n\n```java\npublic class ElitisticListPopulation extends ListPopulation {\n    \n    private final double elitismRate;\n\n    public ElitisticListPopulation(final List<Chromosome> chromosomes,\n                                   final int populationLimit,\n                                   final double elitismRate) {\n        super(chromosomes, populationLimit);\n        \n        if (elitismRate < 0) {\n            throw new OutOfRangeException(elitismRate, 0, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY);\n        }\n        \n        this.elitismRate = elitismRate;\n    }\n    \n    // Rest of the class code...\n}\n```\n\nThis fix adds a check for a negative elitism rate and throws an `OutOfRangeException` if it is negative.\n\nAnother possible fix is to update the test case `ElitisticListPopulationTest.testChromosomeListConstructorTooLow()` to expect a different exception, such as `IllegalArgumentException`, instead of `OutOfRangeException`, if the elitism rate is negative. However, for consistency with the existing code, it is better to fix the constructor itself."

Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."
