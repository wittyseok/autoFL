Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This language extension is not supported in the parser, and hence it throws an \"unsupported language extension: for each\" error.\n\nBased on the information collected, the bug seems to be that the parser does not handle the `for each` language extension correctly. It should either handle it properly or provide a more informative error message indicating that it is not supported.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Update the parser to properly handle the `for each` language extension or provide a more informative error message indicating that it is not supported.\n\nPlease note that the suggested fix is based on the limited information available and further investigation may be required."
