The test compares the results of the `FastMath.min` and `FastMath.max` methods with the corresponding `Math.min` and `Math.max` methods for a set of float values.\n\nLooking at the code of the `FastMath.min` method, we can see that it correctly returns the minimum value of two floats using the ternary operator and checks for NaN using `Float.isNaN(a + b)` (lines 3445-3446).\n\nThe code of the `FastMath.max` method also uses the ternary operator to return the maximum value of two floats. However, it mistakenly uses `b` as the result for both cases, regardless of whether `a` or `b` is greater. It does check for NaN using `Float.isNaN(a + b)` (lines 3481-3482).\n\nIn the failing test, the comparison `Assert.assertEquals(\"max(\" + pair[1] + \", \" + pair[0] + \")\", Math.max(pair[1], pair[0]), FastMath.max(pair[1], pair[0]), MathUtils.EPSILON);` is expecting the result of `FastMath.max(pair[1], pair[0])` to be `Math.max(pair[1], pair[0])`. However, the test fails because for the pair `{-50.0f, 50.0f}`, the expected value is `50.0` but the actual value is `-50.0`.\n\nIt seems that in the `FastMath.max` method, the condition `(a <= b)` needs to be replaced with `(a >= b)` to correctly return the maximum value. \n\nSuggested method to be fixed:\n- `org.apache.commons.math.util.FastMath.max(float, float)`\nThe bug occurred in the method `org.apache.commons.math.util.FastMath.max(float, float)`. The method should be fixed by replacing the condition `(a <= b)` with `(a >= b)` to correctly return the maximum value."
