Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

Then, it executes the `MathUtils.gcd` method with `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `0` as arguments. It expects an `ArithmeticException` to be thrown, and if no exception is thrown, the test fails.\n\nFrom the error message and the test code, it appears that the `MathUtils.gcd` method did not throw the expected `ArithmeticException` when called with `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `0` as arguments.\n\nConsidering this information, it seems that there may be an issue with the implementation of the `MathUtils.gcd` method itself, where it is not correctly handling the case of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `0`. This failure in handling the edge case results in the test failure.\n\nTo fix the bug, the `MathUtils.gcd` method should be modified to handle this special case properly and throw the `ArithmeticException` as expected.\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the suggested locations to fix the bug:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.gcd(int, int)\n```\n\nThe fix should involve updating the `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.gcd` method to handle the case of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `0` correctly, throwing an `ArithmeticException` in such cases."
