The test attempts to append a null object with a fixed width and a padding character to the left side of the `StrBuilder` instance.\n\nBy analyzing the code snippet for the `appendFixedWidthPadLeft` method, we can see that if the width is greater than 0, the method ensures that the `StrBuilder` has enough capacity to accommodate the appended string. Then, it converts the object to a string (`str`) using the `toString` method. If `str` is longer than or equal to the width, it copies the last `width` characters from `str` to the buffer. Otherwise, it pads the buffer with `padChar` for the remaining length (`width - str.length()`) and then copies `str` to the buffer.\n\nThe `NullPointerException` occurred at line 1186, where `str` is attempted to be accessed. This indicates that the `obj` argument passed to the method is `null`, causing the `getNullText` method to be called, which returns `null`. Consequently, calling the `length` method on a `null` object (`str`) results in a `NullPointerException`.\n\nTo fix this issue, the `appendFixedWidthPadLeft` method should handle the case when the `obj` argument is `null` and provide a proper value for `str` to avoid the `NullPointerException`.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder.appendFixedWidthPadLeft(java.lang.Object, int, char)`\n"
