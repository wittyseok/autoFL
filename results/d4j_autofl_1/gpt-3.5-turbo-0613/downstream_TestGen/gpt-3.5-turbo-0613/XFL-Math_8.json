An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "The code snippet for the `DiscreteDistribution` constructor shows that it takes a random generator (`rng`) and a list of pairs (`samples`) as input. The pair consists of a value `T` and a probability `Double`. The constructor initializes the `singletons` array with the values from the `samples` list, and performs some validations on the probabilities. It normalizes the probabilities using the `MathArrays.normalizeArray` method.\n\nSince we have the code snippets for the methods involved (`DiscreteRealDistribution` and `DiscreteDistribution`), we can see that the failing test is calling the `DiscreteDistribution` constructor with incorrect arguments. It is passing an `Object` type instead of the expected `List<Pair<Object, Double>>`. This mismatch in the type of arguments is causing the `ArrayStoreException` to be thrown when the `DiscreteDistribution.sample` method tries to store the objects in the `double[]` array.\n\nTo fix this issue, the test `testIssue942` should be modified to pass the correct arguments to the `DiscreteDistribution` constructor.\n\nSuggestions for fix:\n- Modify `testIssue942` in the `DiscreteRealDistributionTest` class to use the correct arguments for the `DiscreteDistribution` constructor.\n\nCode snippet to fix the test:\n\n```java\n    @Test\n    public void testIssue942() {\n        List<Pair<Object, Double>> list = new ArrayList<Pair<Object, Double>>();\n        list.add(new Pair<Object, Double>(new Object() {}, new Double(0)));\n        list.add(new Pair<Object, Double>(new Object() {}, new Double(1)));\n        Assert.assertEquals(1, new DiscreteDistribution<>(list).sample(1).length);\n    }\n```\n\nNote that the generic type `T` for `DiscreteDistribution` is inferred based on the `singletons` array, so the `Object` type used in this example should be replaced with the type of values expected for `singletons`.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance."
