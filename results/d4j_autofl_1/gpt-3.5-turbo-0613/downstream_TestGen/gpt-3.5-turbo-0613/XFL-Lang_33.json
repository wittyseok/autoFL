                "content": "The failing test `testToClass_object` is in the `ClassUtilsTest` class in the `org.apache.commons.lang3` package. The method being tested is `toClass` in the `ClassUtils` class.\n\nThe failing test calls the `toClass` method with an array of objects and expects a `Class` array as a result. However, the test fails with a `NullPointerException` at line 910 of the `toClass` method in the `ClassUtils` class.\n\nThe code snippet for the `toClass` method is as follows:\n\n```java\n902 :     public static Class<?>[] toClass(Object[] array) {\n903 :         if (array == null) {\n904 :             return null;\n905 :         } else if (array.length == 0) {\n906 :             return ArrayUtils.EMPTY_CLASS_ARRAY;\n907 :         }\n908 :         Class<?>[] classes = new Class[array.length];\n909 :         for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n910 :             classes[i] = array[i].getClass(); // error occurred here\n911 :         }\n912 :         return classes;\n913 :     }\n```\n\nThe problem occurs at line 910, where the code attempts to get the class of each element in the input array. It seems that one of the elements in the array is `null`, which causes a `NullPointerException` to be thrown.\n\nNext, I will suggest the method that needs to be fixed.\nPotential fix:\n\norg.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils.toClass(java.lang.Object[])"
