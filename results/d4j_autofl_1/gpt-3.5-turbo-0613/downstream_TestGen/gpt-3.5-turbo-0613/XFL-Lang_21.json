However, the test failed with the error message \"LANG-677\". Looking at the code snippet for the `isSameLocalTime` method, we can see that it compares the values of the fields of the two calendar objects. If any of the fields differ, the method returns false. \n\nBased on the limited information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the failure. It could be due to one or more of the calendar fields being different between `cal3` and `cal4` in the test. To further investigate, we would need to examine the values of the calendar fields in `cal3` and `cal4` at the point of comparison in the test.\n\nNext, I would suggest checking the implementation of the `isSameLocalTime` method to ensure it correctly compares the calendar fields and returns the expected result.\n\nSuggestions for fixing the bug:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(Calendar, Calendar)`"
