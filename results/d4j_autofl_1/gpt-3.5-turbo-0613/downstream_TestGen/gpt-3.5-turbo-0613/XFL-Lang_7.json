Therefore, the `NumberUtils.createNumber(\"--1.1E-700F\")` call does not throw the expected exception, causing the test to fail.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the `createNumber` method to handle the case where the string starts with `--` and throw a `NumberFormatException`. We can add a check at the beginning of the method to return `null` if the string starts with `--`. This can be done by modifying the code snippet as follows:\n\n```java\n445 : public static Number createNumber(String str) throws NumberFormatException {\n446 :     if (str == null) {\n447 :         return null;\n448 :     }\n449 :     if (StringUtils.isBlank(str)) {\n450 :         throw new NumberFormatException(\"A blank string is not a valid number\");\n451 :     }  \n452 :     if (str.startsWith(\"--\")) {\n453 :         throw new NumberFormatException(\"Invalid number format: string starts with --\");\n454 :     }\n455 :     // ... rest of the code ...\n598 : }\n```\n\nThis modification will ensure that a `NumberFormatException` is thrown when encountering a string starting with `--`, as expected by the test."
