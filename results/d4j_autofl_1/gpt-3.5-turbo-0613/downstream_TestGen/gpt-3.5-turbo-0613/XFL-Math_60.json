Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "Based on the code snippets, here is the step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred in the failing test `testExtremeValues`:\n\n1. The failing test is checking extreme values for the `NormalDistribution` by calculating the cumulative probability for values from `-i` to `i`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `100`.\n\n2. In line 160, the cumulative probability of the lower tail is calculated using the `cumulativeProbability` method of `NormalDistributionImpl`.\n\n3. In line 161, the cumulative probability of the upper tail is also calculated using the same method.\n\n4. Inside the `cumulativeProbability` method, the deviation (`dev`) from the mean is calculated in line 125.\n\n5. The cumulative probability is then calculated as `0.5 * (1.0 + Erf.erf((dev) / (standardDeviation * FastMath.sqrt(2.0))))` in line 127. The `Erf.erf` method is used to calculate the error function.\n\n6. The bug occurs in the calculation of the cumulative probability. When `x` (the input value) is extremely large, the `Erf.erf` method throws a `MaxIterationsExceededException` in line 129.\n\n7. To handle this exception, an if-else block is used in lines 130-134. If `x` is less than the mean minus 20 times the standard deviation, the method returns `0` (line 131). If `x` is greater than the mean plus 20 times the standard deviation, the method returns `1` (line 133). Otherwise, the exception is re-thrown (line 135).\n\n8. In the failing test, when `i` is equal to `10`, the cumulative probability for the upper tail is expected to be `1` (line 170). However, due to the bug in the `cumulativeProbability` method, a `MaxIterationsExceededException` is thrown and not caught, resulting in a test failure.\n\nBased on this information, the bug is located in the `cumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class. The `Erf.erf` method is not handling large input values correctly, causing a `MaxIterationsExceededException` to be thrown instead of returning the expected cumulative probability.\n\nTo fix this bug, the implementation of the `Erf.erf` method or the handling of large input values in the `NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability` method should be modified.\n\nSuggested fix:\n\n- `org.apache.commons.math.special.Erf.erf(double)`\nBased on the information gathered, the bug is located in the `org.apache.commons.math.special.Erf.erf(double)` method which throws a `MaxIterationsExceededException` when calculating the cumulative probability for large input values in the `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability(double)` method.\n\nSuggested fix:\n\n- Modify the implementation of the `org.apache.commons.math.special.Erf.erf(double)` method to handle large input values correctly."
