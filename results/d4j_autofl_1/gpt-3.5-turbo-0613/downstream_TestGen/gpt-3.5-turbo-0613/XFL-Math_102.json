Other classes covered by failing tests in this package are: `TestUtils`, `ChiSquareTestImpl`, and `TTestImpl`.\nThe test `testChiSquareLargeTestStatistic` failed with an assertion error. The expected value for the chi-square test statistic was `114875.90421929007`, but the actual value was `3624883.3429077636`. \n\nThe failing test is calling the method `chiSquareTest` from the class `org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl`. The instance of `ChiSquareTestImpl` is created at line 180. Then, the `chiSquareTest` method is called at line 181 with the input arrays `exp` and `obs`. The failure occurs at line 183, where the method `assertEquals` is used to compare the expected and actual values of the chi-square test statistic.\n\nNow, let's try to retrieve the code snippet for the `chiSquareTest` method in order to analyze its implementation."

The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
