Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The test adds two data points to the time series and then calls the `createCopy` method with invalid parameters. The error message indicates that the method requires the `start` parameter to be less than or equal to the `end` parameter, but this condition is not met, resulting in an `IllegalArgumentException` being thrown.\n\nTo investigate further, let's look at the code snippet for the `createCopy(int, int)` method:\n\n```java\n876 : public TimeSeries createCopy(int start, int end)\n877 :     throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n878 : \n879 :     if (start < 0) {\n880 :         throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Requires start >= 0.\");\n881 :     }\n882 :     if (end < start) {\n883 :         throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Requires start <= end.\");\n884 :     }\n885 :     TimeSeries copy = (TimeSeries) super.clone();\n// ...\n```\n\nAccording to the code snippet and the corresponding JavaDoc documentation, the `createCopy` method creates a new time series by copying a subset of the data from the original time series. The `start` parameter represents the index of the first time period to copy, and the `end` parameter represents the index of the last time period to copy. However, the method expects the `start` parameter to be greater than or equal to 0 and the `end` parameter to be greater than or equal to the `start` parameter.\n\nIn the failing test, the `createCopy` method is called with the `start` parameter set to the index of a time period that occurs after the `end` parameter, violating the condition specified by the method. This causes the `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown, resulting in the test failure.\n\nTo fix this issue, the test should be modified to provide valid parameters for the `createCopy` method, ensuring that the `start` parameter is less than or equal to the `end` parameter.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Modify the test `testBug1864222` to provide valid parameters for the `createCopy` method.\n\nPossible fix location:\n- `org.jfree.data.time.TimeSeries.createCopy(int, int)`"
