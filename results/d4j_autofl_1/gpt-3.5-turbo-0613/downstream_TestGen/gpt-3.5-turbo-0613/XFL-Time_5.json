Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "Based on the code snippet and JavaDoc documentation for the `org.joda.time.Period.normalizedStandard` method, we can see that this method normalizes a period using standard rules. It assumes a 12 month year, 7 day week, 24 hour day, 60 minute hour, and 60 second minute. The method allows you to control how the result is split into fields by providing a `PeriodType` parameter.\n\nIn the failing test, the `normalizedStandard` method is called on a `Period` object with a `PeriodType` of \"months\". The error occurs in the `Period.withYears` method, which is called when the years or months fields of the period are not zero. The error message indicates that the field being used is not supported.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the `Period.normalizedStandard` method is not correctly handling the case when the `PeriodType` does not support non-zero years or months. This is causing the error to occur. To fix this issue, the `normalizedStandard` method should handle this case properly and either throw an exception or handle the unsupported fields in a different way.\n\nTo fix the bug, the following method should be modified:\n\n`org.joda.time.Period.normalizedStandard(PeriodType)`\n\nNo modification needed for the test case at this time.\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months1`\nDetails: The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months1` in the `org.joda.time.TestPeriod_Basics` class is failing. It calls the `normalizedStandard` method of the `Period` class with a `PeriodType` of \"months\". The error occurs in the `withYears` method, which is called when the years or months fields of the period are not zero. The error message indicates that the field being used is not supported.\n\nBased on the code and documentation of the `normalizedStandard` method, it seems that the method is not correctly handling the case when the `PeriodType` does not support non-zero years or months.
