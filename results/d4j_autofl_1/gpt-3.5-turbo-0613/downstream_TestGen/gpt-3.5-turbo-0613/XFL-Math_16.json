The failing test is located in the `FastMathTest` class in the `org.apache.commons.math3.util` package.\n2. The failing test calls the `FastMath.cosh` method on a range of values between `start` and `end`.\n3. Inside the `FastMath.cosh` method, there is a check for `x` being NaN (not-a-number), and if it is NaN, the method returns `x` itself.\n4. For values of `x` greater than 20, the method calculates the result using the `exp` method and a scaling factor of 0.5.\n5. The `exp` method is used to compute the exponential function of a given value.\n6. Inside the `exp` method, there are several calculations and table lookups to compute the exponential value.\n7. The `exp` method returns a result that is then used in further calculations in the `cosh` method.\n8. In the failing test, the `maxErr` variable is initially set to 0.\n9. For each value of `x` between `start` and `end`, the `cosh` method is called and the result is compared to the `Math.cosh` method from the JDK library.\n10. The `maxErr` value is updated with the maximum absolute difference between the two computed values.\n11. Finally, the test asserts that `maxErr` is equal to 0, which means there should be no difference between the two computed values.\n\nBased on the error message and call stack, the test failed because the expected value was 0.0, but the actual value was `Infinity`. This indicates that the computation inside the `cosh` method resulted in an infinite value.\n\nTo fix this bug, we need to investigate the `exp` method and its implementation to see why it is producing an infinite result for some inputs.\nThe bug is occurring in the `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.exp(double)` method, which is used by the `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.cosh(double)` method. The `exp` method is returning an infinite value for certain inputs, resulting in the failure of the `cosh` method and the subsequent test failure.\n\nTo fix this bug, we need to locate and correct the issue within the `exp` method."

The `exp` method is used to compute the exponential function of a given value.\n6. Inside the `exp` method, there are several calculations and table lookups to compute the exponential value.\n7. The `exp` method returns a result that is then used in further calculations in the `cosh` method.\n8. In the failing test, the `maxErr` variable is initially set to 0.\n9. For each value of `x` between `start` and `end`, the `cosh` method is called and the result is compared to the `Math.cosh` method from the JDK library.\n10. The `maxErr` value is updated with the maximum absolute difference between the two computed values.\n11. Finally, the test asserts that `maxErr` is equal to 0, which means there should be no difference between the two computed values.\n\nBased on the error message and call stack, the test failed because the expected value was 0.0, but the actual value was `Infinity`. This indicates that the computation inside the `cosh` method resulted in an infinite value.\n\nTo fix this bug, we need to investigate the `exp` method and its implementation to see why it is producing an infinite result for some inputs.\nThe bug is occurring in the `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.exp(double)` method, which is used by the `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.cosh(double)` method. The `exp` method is returning an infinite value for certain inputs, resulting in the failure of the `cosh` method and the subsequent test failure.\n\nTo fix this bug, we need to locate and correct the issue within the `exp` method."
