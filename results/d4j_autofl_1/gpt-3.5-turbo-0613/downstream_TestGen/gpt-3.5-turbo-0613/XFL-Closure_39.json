Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The error occurred at line 59, where the expected result was \"{loop: ?, number: number, string: string}\", but the actual result was \"{loop: [...], number: number, string: string}\". \n\nLooking at the code snippet of the `RecordType` constructor, we can see that it takes a `JSTypeRegistry` and a map of `RecordProperty` objects as parameters. It sets this map of properties, and then freezes the record type. However, there is no code that adds the `loop` property with the `ProxyObjectType` to the record type.\n\nThe test expects the `loop` property to be present in the record type, but it is missing. This discrepancy between the expected and actual result causes the test failure.\n\nTherefore, the bug is that the `loop` property is not added to the record type.\n\nTo fix this bug, we need to add code to the `RecordType` constructor to add the `loop` property with the `ProxyObjectType` to the record type.\nSuggested fix:\n\ncom.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.RecordType(JSTypeRegistry, Map<String, RecordProperty>)\n\nAdd the following code after line 88:\n\n```\ndefineDeclaredProperty(\"loop\", loop, null);\n```"
