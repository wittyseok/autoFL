The expected result at line 655 was `1`, but the actual result was `100`, which caused the assertion error.\n\nTo investigate further, let's analyze the code snippet of the `reduce` method:\n\n```java\n465: public Fraction reduce() {\n466:     int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);\n467:     if (gcd == 1) {\n468:         return this;\n469:     }\n470:     return Fraction.getFraction(numerator / gcd, denominator / gcd);\n471: }\n```\n\nThe `reduce` method calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of the numerator and denominator using the `greatestCommonDivisor` method. If the `gcd` is `1`, it means that the fraction is already in its simplest form, so it returns the current `Fraction` object. Otherwise, it creates a new `Fraction` object with the numerator divided by the `gcd` and the denominator divided by the `gcd`.\n\nBased on this code, it seems that the `greatestCommonDivisor` method may incorrectly calculate the `gcd` for the given input, resulting in an incorrect reduced fraction. Further investigation is required to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nTo suggest which methods could be causing the issue, we can consider the following candidates:\n\n1. `greatestCommonDivisor(int, int)`: This method calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers and is used in the `reduce` method to determine if the fraction is already in its simplest form. There may be a logic error in this method that causes it to return an incorrect `gcd`.\n2. `.getNumerator()`: This method returns the numerator of a `Fraction` object.

The expected result at line 655 was `1`, but the actual result was `100`, which caused the assertion error.\n\nTo investigate further, let's analyze the code snippet of the `reduce` method:\n\n```java\n465: public Fraction reduce() {\n466:     int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);\n467:     if (gcd == 1) {\n468:         return this;\n469:     }\n470:     return Fraction.getFraction(numerator / gcd, denominator / gcd);\n471: }\n```\n\nThe `reduce` method calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of the numerator and denominator using the `greatestCommonDivisor` method. If the `gcd` is `1`, it means that the fraction is already in its simplest form, so it returns the current `Fraction` object. Otherwise, it creates a new `Fraction` object with the numerator divided by the `gcd` and the denominator divided by the `gcd`.\n\nBased on this code, it seems that the `greatestCommonDivisor` method may incorrectly calculate the `gcd` for the given input, resulting in an incorrect reduced fraction. Further investigation is required to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nTo suggest which methods could be causing the issue, we can consider the following candidates:\n\n1. `greatestCommonDivisor(int, int)`: This method calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers and is used in the `reduce` method to determine if the fraction is already in its simplest form. There may be a logic error in this method that causes it to return an incorrect `gcd`.\n2. `.getNumerator()`: This method returns the numerator of a `Fraction` object. Although not directly used in the `reduce` method, it is possible that there is a bug in this method that affects the calculations in the `reduce` method.\n3. `.getDenominator()`: This method returns the denominator of a `Fraction` object. Similar to the `.getNumerator()` method, it may have a bug that impacts the `reduce` method.\n\nTherefore, the potential locations to fix the bug are:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.greatestCommonDivisor(int, int)\norg.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.getNumerator()\norg.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.getDenominator()\n```"
