The error occurred at the line `assertEquals(10.0, solution.getPoint()[0], 0.0);` in the `testSingleVariableAndConstraint` method.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to investigate the implementation of the `SimplexTableau`, `solvePhase1`, `isOptimal`, and `doIteration` methods in order to identify any possible bugs or incorrect calculations.\nTo fix the issue, I would suggest looking into the following methods in the `SimplexSolver` class:\n\n- `doOptimize()` - This method orchestrates the optimization process. Check if there are any bugs in the iteration logic or if any steps are missing.\n\n- `solvePhase1(SimplexTableau)` - Investigate this method to ensure that the phase-1 optimization is correctly performed.\n\n- `isOptimal(SimplexTableau)` - Review this method to verify that it correctly determines whether the tableau is in an optimal state.\n\n- `doIteration(SimplexTableau)` - Examine this method to check for any bugs in the iteration logic.\n\nIt's possible that the bug lies within one of these methods, leading to the incorrect optimization result observed in the failing test."

Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.
