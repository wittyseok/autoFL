This leads to the failure of the test.\n\nTo confirm the exact cause, we would need to examine the code for the missing constructor `Fraction(double value, double epsilon, int infinite, int maxIterations)`. Unfortunately, we don't have access to that code snippet.\n\nConsidering the information we have so far, it appears that there might be an issue with the `Fraction` constructor, specifically with how it handles the input value `-1.0e10`. It is possible that the constructor fails to detect a convergence problem, which leads to the exception not being thrown as expected.\n\nNext, let's suggest some methods that could potentially be fixed to address this issue:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction.<init>(double, double, int)\n```\n\nIt would be ideal to inspect the code for the missing constructor to provide a more accurate diagnosis and suggest the appropriate fix."
