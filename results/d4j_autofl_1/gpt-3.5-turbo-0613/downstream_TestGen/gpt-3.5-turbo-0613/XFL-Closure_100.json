The test is failing with an unexpected error: `JSC_USED_GLOBAL_THIS. dangerous use of the global this object at testcode line 1 : 35 expected:<0> but was:<1>`. \n\nTo understand the cause of the failure, let's inspect the relevant methods in the `CheckGlobalThis` class. The constructor of `CheckGlobalThis` takes an `AbstractCompiler` and a `CheckLevel` as arguments, as shown below:\n```java\nCheckGlobalThis(AbstractCompiler compiler, CheckLevel level) {\n  this.compiler = compiler;\n  this.level = level;\n}\n```\nThere is a private method `shouldReportThis` that determines if a `Node` and its parent should be reported as a dangerous use of the `this` object. Here is the code snippet for that method:\n```java\nprivate boolean shouldReportThis(Node n, Node parent) {\n  if (assignLhsChild != null) {\n    // Always report a THIS on the left side of an assign.\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  // Also report a THIS with a property access.\n  return false;\n}\n```\n\nBased on the available information, it seems that the test is checking for a specific error `JSC_USED_GLOBAL_THIS` to be reported, but it is expecting the occurrence count to be 0 while the actual count is 1. The cause of this discrepancy could be related to how the `shouldReportThis` method is implemented or how the `Node` and its parent are being handled.\n\nLet's investigate the `getFunctionJsDocInfo` method to see if it provides any additional insight. Here is the code snippet for that method:\n```java\nprivate JSDocInfo getFunctionJsDocInfo(Node n) {\n  JSDocInfo jsDoc = n.getJSDocInfo();\n  Node parent = n.getParent();\n  if (jsDoc == null) {\n    int parentType = parent.getType();\n    if (parentType == Token.NAME || parentType == Token.ASSIGN) {\n      jsDoc = parent.getJSDocInfo();\n      if (jsDoc == null && parentType == Token.NAME) {\n        Node gramps = parent.getParent();\n        if (gramps.getType() == Token.VAR) {\n          jsDoc = gramps.getJSDocInfo();\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return jsDoc;\n}\n```\n\nAfter reviewing the code snippets, it is clear that the failure in the test is not directly related to the `CheckGlobalThis` constructor or the `shouldReportThis` method. However, further investigation would be required to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure.\n\nSuggested locations to investigate and potentially fix:\n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckGlobalThis.getFunctionJsDocInfo(com.google.javascript.rhino.Node)`\n- Other relevant methods in the `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckGlobalThis` class.\n\nPlease note that without access to the complete source code and additional context, it is difficult to provide a precise solution."

The test is failing with an unexpected error: `JSC_USED_GLOBAL_THIS. dangerous use of the global this object at testcode line 1 : 35 expected:<0> but was:<1>`. \n\nTo understand the cause of the failure, let's inspect the relevant methods in the `CheckGlobalThis` class. The constructor of `CheckGlobalThis` takes an `AbstractCompiler` and a `CheckLevel` as arguments, as shown below:\n```java\nCheckGlobalThis(AbstractCompiler compiler, CheckLevel level) {\n  this.compiler = compiler;\n  this.level = level;\n}\n```\nThere is a private method `shouldReportThis` that determines if a `Node` and its parent should be reported as a dangerous use of the `this` object. Here is the code snippet for that method:\n```java\nprivate boolean shouldReportThis(Node n, Node parent) {\n  if (assignLhsChild != null) {\n    // Always report a THIS on the left side of an assign.\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  // Also report a THIS with a property access.\n  return false;\n}\n```\n\nBased on the available information, it seems that the test is checking for a specific error `JSC_USED_GLOBAL_THIS` to be reported, but it is expecting the occurrence count to be 0 while the actual count is 1. The cause of this discrepancy could be related to how the `shouldReportThis` method is implemented or how the `Node` and its parent are being handled.\n\nLet's investigate the `getFunctionJsDocInfo` method to see if it provides any additional insight. Here is the code snippet for that method:\n```java\nprivate JSDocInfo getFunctionJsDocInfo(Node n) {\n  JSDocInfo jsDoc = n.getJSDocInfo();\n  Node parent = n.getParent();\n  if (jsDoc == null) {\n    int parentType = parent.getType();\n    if (parentType == Token.NAME || parentType == Token.ASSIGN) {\n      jsDoc = parent.getJSDocInfo();\n      if (jsDoc == null && parentType == Token.NAME) {\n        Node gramps = parent.getParent();\n        if (gramps.getType() == Token.VAR) {\n          jsDoc = gramps.getJSDocInfo();\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return jsDoc;\n}\n```\n\nAfter reviewing the code snippets, it is clear that the failure in the test is not directly related to the `CheckGlobalThis` constructor or the `shouldReportThis` method. However, further investigation would be required to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure.\n\nSuggested locations to investigate and potentially fix:\n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckGlobalThis.getFunctionJsDocInfo(com.google.javascript.rhino.Node)`\n- Other relevant methods in the `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckGlobalThis` class.\n\nPlease note that without access to the complete source code and additional context, it is difficult to provide a precise solution."
