Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The test is checking the result of the `getResult` method of the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class. \n\nLooking at the code snippet provided for the `testQuinticMin` method, we see that the expected result is `-0.27195612846834`, but the actual result is `-0.27194301946870036`. This difference in the results leads to the test failure.\n\nThe `getResult` method is called on the `minimizer` object of type `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer`. This method retrieves the computed result of the optimization process.\n\nTo investigate further, I retrieved the code snippets for the methods involved in the test. \n\nThe `setResult` method from the `AbstractUnivariateRealOptimizer` class is responsible for setting the computed result, function value, and iteration count. However, it is not directly involved in the computation of the result.\n\nThe `getOptima` method of the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class is used to retrieve the computed optimal values. It throws an exception when no optimum is computed yet.\n\nThe `getOptimaValues` method of the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class is used to retrieve the computed optimal function values. It also throws an exception when no optimum is computed yet.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the issue lies in the computation of the result within the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class.\nTo fix the issue, the method `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer.getResult()` needs to be examined and modified accordingly."
