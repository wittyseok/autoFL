The expected output contains the escaped characters `\\\"`, while the actual output contains the unicode representation `\\u0000`. This indicates that the escaping of characters is not happening correctly during the printing process.\n\nTo fix the issue, the code responsible for escaping characters needs to be examined and modified accordingly. This could involve checking the implementation of methods like `setEscapeHtml(boolean)` or `setEscapeHtmlEntities(boolean)` in the `CodePrinter.Builder` class.\n\nIn summary, the bug is occurring due to incorrect character escaping in the `CodePrinter` class during the printing process. The following methods need to be fixed:\n\n```\ncom.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.Builder.setEscapeHtml(boolean)\ncom.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.Builder.setEscapeHtmlEntities(boolean)\n```"
