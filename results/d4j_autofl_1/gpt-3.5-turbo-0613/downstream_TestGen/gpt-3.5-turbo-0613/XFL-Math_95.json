Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "The test `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest.testSmallDegreesOfFreedom()` failed with an `IllegalArgumentException` at line 114. The error message indicates that the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of `FDistributionImpl` received invalid endpoint parameters.\n\nTo investigate further, I looked into the code of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and found that it calls a method `bracket` from `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` class to find a bracketing interval. The `bracket` method takes an initial guess and two endpoint bounds as parameters.\n\nLooking at the code of the `bracket` method, I found that it performs an iterative process to find a bracketing interval by expanding the bounds around the initial guess. It checks for invalid arguments and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if any of the conditions are violated.\n\nIn the failing test, the `FDistributionImpl` object is created with degrees of freedom values of 1.0 and 1.0. Then, the `cumulativeProbability` method is called to calculate the cumulative probability for a value of 0.975. Finally, the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method is called with the calculated probability.\n\nBased on the error message, it seems that the endpoint parameters passed to the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method are incorrect. It's possible that the initial guess or the bounds used for finding the bracketing interval are causing the problem.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in `FDistributionImpl` should be modified to ensure that the endpoint parameters are valid before calling the `bracket` method. This can be done by checking the initial guess and the bounds against the required conditions and throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if any of the conditions are violated.\n\nThe relevant methods that need to be fixed are:\n- `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability(double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealFunction, double, double, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealFunction, double, double, double, int)`\n\nPlease note that the actual fix may require further investigation and understanding of the code. The suggested methods are based on the information available at the moment."
