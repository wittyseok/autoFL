It then writes the number of shapes in the `ShapeList` using `stream.writeInt(count)`. For each shape, it writes the index and the shape itself using `SerialUtilities.writeShape(shape, stream)`. If a shape is `null`, it writes -1 as the index.\n\nThe `readObject` method is implemented as follows:\n\n```java\n157: private void readObject(ObjectInputStream stream) throws IOException,\n158:         ClassNotFoundException {\n159: \n160:     stream.defaultReadObject();\n161:     int count = stream.readInt();\n162:     for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n163:         int index = stream.readInt();\n164:         if (index != -1) {\n165:             setShape(index, SerialUtilities.readShape(stream));\n166:         }\n167:     }\n168: \n169: }\n```\n\nThis method reads the object's default serialized form using `stream.defaultReadObject()`. It then reads the number of shapes from the stream using `stream.readInt()`. For each shape, it reads the index and the shape itself using `SerialUtilities.readShape(stream)` and calls the `setShape` method of the `ShapeList` to set the shape at the corresponding index.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the serialization and deserialization of the `ShapeList` objects might not be preserving the equality between the original and deserialized objects.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can check the implementation of the `equals` method in the `ShapeList` class and ensure that it properly compares the shapes in the list. Additionally, you may want to review the implementation of the `hashCode` method to ensure consistency with the `equals` method.\n\nHere are the methods that would be the best locations to be fixed:\n- `org.jfree.chart.util.ShapeList.equals(java.lang.Object)`\n- `org.jfree.chart.util.ShapeList.hashCode()`\n\nRemember to review the implementation of these methods and make necessary modifications to ensure the correct comparison of objects."
