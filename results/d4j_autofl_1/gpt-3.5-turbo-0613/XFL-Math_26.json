Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This leads to the failure of the test.\n\nTo confirm the exact cause, we would need to examine the code for the missing constructor `Fraction(double value, double epsilon, int infinite, int maxIterations)`. Unfortunately, we don't have access to that code snippet.\n\nConsidering the information we have so far, it appears that there might be an issue with the `Fraction` constructor, specifically with how it handles the input value `-1.0e10`. It is possible that the constructor fails to detect a convergence problem, which leads to the exception not being thrown as expected.\n\nNext, let's suggest some methods that could potentially be fixed to address this issue:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction.<init>(double, double, int)\n```\n\nIt would be ideal to inspect the code for the missing constructor to provide a more accurate diagnosis and suggest the appropriate fix."
