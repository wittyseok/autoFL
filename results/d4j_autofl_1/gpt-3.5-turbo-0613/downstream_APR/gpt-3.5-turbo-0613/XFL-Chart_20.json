The test is expecting the outline paint to be `Color.blue`, but it is actually `Color.red`.\n\nTo fix this issue, we would need to update the test expectation or investigate why the `ValueMarker` instance is not properly initialized with the expected `outlinePaint` value.\nThe bug occurred because the test `ValueMarkerTests.test1808376` expected the `outlinePaint` property of a `ValueMarker` instance to be `Color.blue`, but in fact it was `Color.red`. This indicates that there is a problem with the initialization of the `ValueMarker` instance in the test or in the implementation of the `ValueMarker` class itself.\n\nTo fix this bug, we can suggest making the appropriate adjustments to the test to match the expected outcome. However, without access to the implementation of the `ValueMarker` class or additional information about the intention behind the test, it is difficult to determine the exact fix.\n\nPossible fix locations:\n- `org.jfree.chart.plot.ValueMarker`: Adjust the initialization of the `outlinePaint` property in the `ValueMarker` constructor to match the expected value."
