Instead, we calculate the `week` value directly using the `firstMillisecond` attribute of the `Week` instance. This ensures that the correct `week` value is returned even if the member variable is not set correctly.\n\nI have modified the code to use the `firstMillisecond` attribute to determine the `week` value.

It uses a `Calendar` instance initialized with the `Europe/Copenhagen` time zone and the default locale. It sets the year and week of the `Calendar` instance to the values stored in the `Week` object and sets the day of the week to the first day of the week according to the `Calendar` instance.\n\nIf the week number stored in the `Week` object is less than 52, it adds 7 days to the `Calendar` instance to check if it goes to the next year. If the year of the `Calendar` instance is greater than the year stored in the `Week` object, it means that the week belongs to the next year, so it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the original week value.\n\nNote: The modification assumes that the first day of the week is always Monday, as indicated by the comment `// first day of week is monday` in the original code. If this assumption is incorrect, the logic for setting the `Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK` may need to be adjusted accordingly.",

Both constructors perform initialization of the `week` member variable based on the provided `time`, `zone`, and `locale` values.\n\nIn the `Week(Date time, TimeZone zone, Locale locale)` constructor, the `week` variable is calculated based on the week of the year obtained from the `Calendar` instance.

These could potentially shed light on why the calculated `week` value is different from the expected value in the failing test.\nTo fix the bug, we need to investigate the values of the input parameters (`time`, `zone`, and `locale`) passed to the `Week` constructor, as well as the conditions and calculations in the constructor that determine the `week` value.
