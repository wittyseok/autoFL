However, it is likely used somewhere else in the code to obtain the info extractor for a given name.\n\nTo fix the issue in the failing test, we need to ensure that the `FacebookIE` class is registered as a supported extractor in the `gen_extractors` function. This can be achieved by adding an instance of the `FacebookIE` class to the list returned by the `gen_extractors` function, as shown below:\n\n```python\ndef gen_extractors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a list of an instance of every supported extractor.\n    The order does matter; the first extractor matched is the one handling the URL.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [klass() for klass in _ALL_CLASSES] + [FacebookIE()]\n```\n\nBy including the `FacebookIE` class in the list of supported extractors, the `gen_extractors` function will ensure that the `FacebookIE` class is available for the `get_info_extractor` function to retrieve when needed.\n\nPlease note that this fix assumes that the `FacebookIE` class is missing from the `_ALL_CLASSES` list and needs to be added. If the `_ALL_CLASSES` list already includes the `FacebookIE` class, then the issue lies elsewhere and further investigation is needed.\nSuggested fix:\n- `youtube_dl.extractor.__init__.gen_extractors()`"

It does this by accessing the `globals()` dictionary and retrieving the value associated with the key `ie_name+'IE'`.\n\nThe `get_info_extractor` function is not directly related to the failing test `test_facebook_matching`. However, it is likely used somewhere else in the code to obtain the info extractor for a given name.\n\nTo fix the issue in the failing test, we need to ensure that the `FacebookIE` class is registered as a supported extractor in the `gen_extractors` function. This can be achieved by adding an instance of the `FacebookIE` class to the list returned by the `gen_extractors` function, as shown below:\n\n```python\ndef gen_extractors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a list of an instance of every supported extractor.\n    The order does matter; the first extractor matched is the one handling the URL.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [klass() for klass in _ALL_CLASSES] + [FacebookIE()]\n```\n\nBy including the `FacebookIE` class in the list of supported extractors, the `gen_extractors` function will ensure that the `FacebookIE` class is available for the `get_info_extractor` function to retrieve when needed.\n\nPlease note that this fix assumes that the `FacebookIE` class is missing from the `_ALL_CLASSES` list and needs to be added. If the `_ALL_CLASSES` list already includes the `FacebookIE` class, then the issue lies elsewhere and further investigation is needed.\nSuggested fix:\n- `youtube_dl.extractor.__init__.gen_extractors()`"
