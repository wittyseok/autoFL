However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The test expects an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown, indicating that both the array and the element are `null`.\n\nBased on the code, the error occurs at line 232 where `ArrayUtils.add(stringArray, aString)` is called. The exception thrown is a `java.lang.ClassCastException` with the message `Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.String;`.\n\nThe error message suggests that the attempt to cast the returned array to `String[]` failed because it is actually an `Object[]`, resulting in a `ClassCastException`.\n\nBased on our analysis so far, it seems that the `copyArrayGrow1` method might not be handling the case when the original array is `null` correctly, possibly leading to the incorrect component type being used when creating the new array.\n\nTo fix this issue, the `copyArrayGrow1` method could be modified to handle the case when the original array is `null` and create the new array with the appropriate component type specified by `newArrayComponentType`. Additionally, the `.add(T[], T)` method in the `ArrayUtils` class could be modified to ensure that the component type of the returned array matches the expected type.\n\nThe suggested methods to be fixed are:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils.copyArrayGrow1(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Class<?>)`\n- `org.apache.commons.lang3.ArrayUtils.add(T[], T)`"
