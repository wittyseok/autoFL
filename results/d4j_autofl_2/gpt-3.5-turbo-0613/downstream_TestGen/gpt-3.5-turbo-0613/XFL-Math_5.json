Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

It handles different cases, including when the complex number is `NaN`, has zero real and imaginary parts, or is infinite.\n\nThere are no additional comments or documentation available for the `.reciprocal()` method.\n\nLet's move on to other relevant methods in the `Complex` class. The `toString()` method converts the complex number to a string representation, the `equals(Object)` method checks the equality of two complex numbers, and the `Complex(double, double)` constructor initializes the complex number with the given real and imaginary parts.\n\nHere are the code snippets for these methods:\n\n1. `toString()` method:\n   ```java\n   1227: @Override\n   1228: public String toString() {\n   1229:     return \"(\" + real + \", \" + imaginary + \")\";\n   1230: }\n   ```\n\n2. `equals(Object)` method:\n   ```java\n   338: @Override\n   339: public boolean equals(Object other) {\n   340:     if (this == other) {\n   341:         return true;\n   342:     }\n   343:     if (other instanceof Complex){\n   344:         Complex c = (Complex)other;\n   345:         if (c.isNaN) {\n   346:             return isNaN;\n   347:         } else {\n   348:             return (real == c.real) && (imaginary == c.imaginary);\n   349:         }\n   350:     }\n   351:     return false;\n   352: }\n   ```\n\n3. `Complex(double, double)` constructor:\n   ```java\n    98: public Complex(double real, double imaginary) {\n    99:     this.real = real;\n   100:     this.imaginary = imaginary;\n\n   102:     isNaN = Double.isNaN(real) || Double.isNaN(imaginary);\n   103:     isInfinite = !isNaN &&\n   104:         (Double.isInfinite(real) || Double.isInfinite(imaginary));\n   105: }\n   ```\n\nDo you need any more information?"
