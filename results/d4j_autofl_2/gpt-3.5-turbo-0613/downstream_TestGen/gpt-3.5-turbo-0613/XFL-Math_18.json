Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "The failing test `testFitAccuracyDependsOnBoundary` in the `CMAESOptimizerTest` class calls the `optimize` method of the `CMAESOptimizer` class. It performs three optimization runs with different boundaries specified using the `lower` and `upper` arrays.\n\nIn the first run, no bounds are specified, and the result is stored in the `resNoBound` variable. In the second and third runs, the bounds are set to `[-20]` and `[5e16]` in the first iteration, and then modified to `[-5e16]` and `[20]` in the second iteration, respectively. The results of these two runs are stored in the `resNearLo` and `resNearHi` variables.\n\nAfter the optimization runs, the test compares the `resNoBound` value with the `resNearLo` and `resNearHi` values using the `Assert.assertEquals` method.\n\nThe test failure occurred at line 477, where the `Assert.assertEquals` method is called. The expected value is `resNoBound`, which is `11.099999992700928`, but the actual value is `8.0`.\n\nNext, I will suggest the locations in the code where the bug might be.\nThe bug might be located in the `CMAESOptimizer` class, specifically in the `optimize` method, where the optimization runs are performed. Additionally, there might be an issue with how the boundaries are handled during the optimization process.\n\nTo further investigate the issue and provide a more accurate diagnosis, I would need to examine the code for the `CMAESOptimizer.optimize` method. Please use the `get_code_snippet` function to retrieve the code for this method, and I will analyze it."
