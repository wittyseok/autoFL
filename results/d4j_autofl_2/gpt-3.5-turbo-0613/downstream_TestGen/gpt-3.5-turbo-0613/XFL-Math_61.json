However, the test failure indicates that the exception is not being thrown as expected. \n\nLooking at the code of the `PoissonDistributionImpl` class, we can see that there are two available constructors: `PoissonDistributionImpl(double, double, int)` and `PoissonDistributionImpl(double)`. The constructor used in the test is `PoissonDistributionImpl(double)`, which calls the other constructor with default values for the `epsilon` and `maxIterations` parameters.\n\nIn the code snippet of the `PoissonDistributionImpl(double)` constructor, we can see that it calls the `PoissonDistributionImpl(double, double, int)` constructor with the provided mean value, default values for `epsilon` and `maxIterations`.

                "content": "Title: Diagnosis of test `testMean`\nDetails: The test `testMean` checks whether a `NotStrictlyPositiveException` is thrown when a negative mean value is passed to the `PoissonDistributionImpl` constructor. However, the test failure indicates that the exception is not being thrown as expected. \n\nLooking at the code of the `PoissonDistributionImpl` class, we can see that there are two available constructors: `PoissonDistributionImpl(double, double, int)` and `PoissonDistributionImpl(double)`. The constructor used in the test is `PoissonDistributionImpl(double)`, which calls the other constructor with default values for the `epsilon` and `maxIterations` parameters.\n\nIn the code snippet of the `PoissonDistributionImpl(double)` constructor, we can see that it calls the `PoissonDistributionImpl(double, double, int)` constructor with the provided mean value, default values for `epsilon` and `maxIterations`. The `PoissonDistributionImpl(double, double, int)` constructor checks if the mean value is positive and throws a `MathRuntimeException` with a `NOT_POSITIVE_POISSON_MEAN` message if it is not.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the test failure occurs because the `PoissonDistributionImpl` constructor is not correctly throwing the `NotStrictlyPositiveException` when a negative mean value is passed.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the `PoissonDistributionImpl` class to properly throw the `NotStrictlyPositiveException` when the mean value is not positive.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Modify the `PoissonDistributionImpl` class to throw `NotStrictlyPositiveException` in the constructor when the mean value is not positive.\n\nCode snippet of the suggested fix:\n```java\npublic PoissonDistributionImpl(double p) {\n    if (p <= 0) {\n        throw new NotStrictlyPositiveException();\n    }\n    this.mean = p;\n    this.normal = new NormalDistributionImpl(p, FastMath.sqrt(p));\n    this.epsilon = DEFAULT_EPSILON;\n    this.maxIterations = DEFAULT_MAX_ITERATIONS;\n}\n```\n\nNote: This fix assumes that the `NotStrictlyPositiveException` is an appropriate exception to throw in this scenario. If there is another more specific exception available for this situation, it should be used instead.\norg.apache.commons.math.distribution.PoissonDistributionImpl.<init>(double)"
