However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

In this test, a `JSError` object is created with a source file name (`javascript/complex.js`) and line number (6 and column number 7), and a `LightweightMessageFormatter` object is instantiated with the string \"if (foo\". The test then asserts that the formatted error message returned by the `formatError` method matches the expected error message.\n\nThe failure of the test indicates that the actual error message returned by the `formatError` method does not match the expected error message. The error message difference is highlighted at line 100:\n\n```\nexpected:<...iption here\nif (foo\n[       ^\n]> but was:<...iption here\nif (foo\n```\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the `formatError` method is not properly formatting the error message, specifically the caret symbol (^) indicating the location of the error.\n\nTo investigate further, let's retrieve the code snippet for the `LightweightMessageFormatter.formatError` method."
