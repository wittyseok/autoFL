Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This test is checking the `getResult` method of the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class.\n\nLooking at the code snippet of the `getResult` method, we can see that it simply returns the result obtained from the `optimizer` object, which is an instance of the `UnivariateRealOptimizer` interface.\n\nBased on the error message and the assertion failed, the expected value is `-0.27195612846834`, but the actual value is `-0.27194301946870036`. The two values differ after the 10th decimal place.\n\nTo further investigate the cause of the failure, we should examine the implementation of the `UnivariateRealOptimizer` interface and its concrete implementations, such as `BrentOptimizer`.\n\nPlease suggest the next method to retrieve the code snippet in order to continue the diagnosis."
