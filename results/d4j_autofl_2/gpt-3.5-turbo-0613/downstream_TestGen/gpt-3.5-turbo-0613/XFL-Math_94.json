The incorrect result is caused by a logical error in the calculation of the greatest common divisor.\n\nTo fix this bug, the following method needs to be fixed:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.gcd(int, int)\n```\n\nThis method should be reviewed and modified to ensure that it correctly calculates the greatest common divisor.\n\nNext, please use the `get_comments` function to retrieve the JavaDoc documentation for the `gcd` method."

Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.
