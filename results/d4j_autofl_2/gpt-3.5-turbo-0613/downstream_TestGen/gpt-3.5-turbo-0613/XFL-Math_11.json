Then, a `NormalDistribution` object is created with the same mean and variance. The test compares the density values obtained from the `uni.density` and `multi.density` methods for 100 random values between -5 and 5.\n\nThe test failure occurred on line 151, where the test used the `Assert.assertEquals` method to compare the expected density value (`uni.density(v)`) with the actual density value (`multi.density(new double[] { v })`). The test expected a density value of `0.28811985736172335` but got `0.7222093809455465` instead.\n\nTo investigate the cause of the failure, we need to examine the implementation of the `density` method in the `MultivariateNormalDistribution` class.\n\nCall the `get_code_snippet` function to retrieve the code snippet for the `density` method in the `MultivariateNormalDistribution` class."
