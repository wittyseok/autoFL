The test is checking the behavior of the `getGreatestSubtype` method of the `UnionType` class. The expected result is `NO_OBJECT_TYPE`, but the actual result is `None`, which caused the assertion failure.\n\nTo investigate further, let's take a look at the code snippet of the test:\n\n```java\n157 :   public void testGreatestSubtypeUnionTypes5() throws Exception {\n158 :     JSType errUnion = createUnionType(EVAL_ERROR_TYPE, URI_ERROR_TYPE);\n159 :     assertEquals(NO_OBJECT_TYPE, // error occurred here\n160 :         errUnion.getGreatestSubtype(STRING_OBJECT_TYPE));\n161 :   }\n```\n\nBased on the code snippet, it seems that the test is creating a union type `errUnion` using the `createUnionType` method, with `EVAL_ERROR_TYPE` and `URI_ERROR_TYPE` as the parameters. Then, it calls the `getGreatestSubtype` method of `errUnion`, passing `STRING_OBJECT_TYPE` as the argument, and expects the result to be `NO_OBJECT_TYPE`.\n\nThe failure occurred at line 159, where the `assertEquals` method is called with `NO_OBJECT_TYPE` as the expected value. However, the actual value returned from `errUnion.getGreatestSubtype(STRING_OBJECT_TYPE)` was `None`.\n\nTo understand why the actual value is `None` instead of the expected `NO_OBJECT_TYPE`, we need to examine the implementation of the `getGreatestSubtype` method in the `UnionType` class. Unfortunately, I was unable to retrieve the code snippet or comments for the `getGreatestSubtype` method at this time.\n\nPlease try again by calling `get_code_snippet` or `get_comments` specifically for the `UnionType.getGreatestSubtype` method, so that we can investigate further into the cause of the issue."
