Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

It then populates these arrays by iterating over a collection of `WeightedObservedPoint` objects. Finally, it performs the fit using an optimizer and returns the resulting point vector.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that the `OutOfMemoryError` might be caused by a large number of observations in the least squares problem. The memory usage could increase exponentially with the number"
