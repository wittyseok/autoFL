                "content": "The failing test is calling the `org.joda.time.Period.normalizedStandard` method, which internally invokes the `withYears` method with an argument of type `int`. The method `withYears` is implemented in the `org.joda.time.Period` class and sets the `years` field of the period object using the `setIndexedField` method of the `org.joda.time.PeriodType` class. However, the `setIndexedField` method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` with the message \"Field is not supported\" when called with certain arguments.\n\nHere is the code snippet for the `withYears` method:\n\n```java\npublic Period withYears(int years) {\n    int[] values = getValues();  // cloned\n    getPeriodType().setIndexedField(this, PeriodType.YEAR_INDEX, values, years);\n    return new Period(values, getPeriodType());\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is the code snippet for the `setIndexedField` method in the `PeriodType` class:\n\n```java\nboolean setIndexedField(ReadablePeriod period, int index, int[] values, int newValue) {\n    int realIndex = iIndices[index];\n    if (realIndex == -1) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Field is not supported\");\n    }\n    values[realIndex] = newValue;\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nTo fix this issue, the `setIndexedField` method in the `PeriodType` class should support the field being accessed by the `withYears` method.\nBased on the analysis, the `org.joda.time.PeriodType.setIndexedField` method needs to be fixed to support the field being accessed by the `org.joda.time.Period.withYears` method.\n\nTo fix the bug, the following method should be modified:\n\n```\norg.joda.time.PeriodType.setIndexedField(ReadablePeriod, int, int[], int)\n```"
