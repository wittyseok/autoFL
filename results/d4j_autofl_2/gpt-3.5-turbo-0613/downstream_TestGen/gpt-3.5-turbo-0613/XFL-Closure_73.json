However, the test failure indicates that the expected string `\"var x=\\\"\\\\u007f\\\"\"` does not match the actual string `\"var x=\"[\u007f]\"'\"`. The failure occurs at line 1215, where the `assertPrint` method is called.\n\nTo understand the issue, let's take a look at the `assertPrint` method in the `CodePrinterTest` class. The `assertPrint` method takes two `String` arguments: `js` and `expected`. It parses the `expected` string to validate that it is a valid JavaScript code. Then it compares the `expected` string with the result of calling `parsePrint` method on the `js` string.\n\nNow, let's examine the `testUnicode` method.
