In this test, a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix `m` is decomposed using the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` constructor, and the resulting root matrix `root` is obtained using the `getRootMatrix` method. The test asserts that the difference between the product of `root` and its transpose and the original matrix `m` should have a norm of approximately 0. However, the test fails with the error message \"junit.framework.AssertionFailedError\" at line 71, indicating that the assertion in line 71 failed.\n\nAfter analyzing the code snippet of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix` method, we can see that it simply returns the `root` matrix without performing any additional operations.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, we can examine the comments for the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` constructor. According to the comments, this constructor decomposes a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix and takes two parameters: `matrix`, which is the symmetric positive semidefinite matrix to be decomposed, and `small`, which is the threshold for discarding dependent columns. If the input matrix is not positive semidefinite, the constructor throws a `NonPositiveDefiniteMatrixException`.\n\nBased on this information, it is possible that the input matrix `m` in the test `testFullRank` is not positive semidefinite. This could lead to an incorrect decomposition, causing the assertion to fail.\n\nTo fix this issue, one possible solution is to modify the test case to use a positive semidefinite matrix as input. Another solution is to handle the case of a non-positive semidefinite matrix in the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` constructor by throwing an appropriate exception or handling the error condition gracefully.\n\nSuggested fixes:\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition(org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RealMatrix, double)`\n- `org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecompositionTest.testFullRank()`"
