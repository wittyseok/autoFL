Upon investigation, the failure seems to be caused by incorrect calculations in the methods `mannWhitneyU` and `calculateAsymptoticPValue`.\n\nTo fix the issue, we suggest the following:\n\n1. In the `mannWhitneyU` method:\n   - Ensure that the `ensureDataConformance` method is correctly validating the input arrays `x` and `y`.\n   - Verify the correctness of the concatenation of the arrays `x` and `y` into `z`.\n   - Check if the ranks are calculated accurately using the `naturalRanking.rank` method.\n\n2.

However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

Let's take a look at the code snippet for the `calculateAsymptoticPValue` method:\n\n```java\n168 :     private double calculateAsymptoticPValue(final double Umin,\n169 :                                              final int n1,\n170 :                                              final int n2)\n171 :         throws ConvergenceException, MaxCountExceededException {\n172 : \n173 :         final int n1n2prod = n1 * n2;\n174 : \n175 :         // http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U#Normal_approximation\n176 :         final double EU = n1n2prod / 2.0;\n177 :         final double VarU = n1n2prod * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12.0;\n178 : \n179 :         final double z = (Umin - EU) / FastMath.sqrt(VarU);\n180 : \n181 :         final NormalDistribution standardNormal = new NormalDistribution(0, 1);\n182 : \n183 :         return 2 * standardNormal.cumulativeProbability(z);\n184 :     }\n```\n\nIn this method, the p-value is calculated using a normal approximation method described in the comment at line 175. The variables `EU` and `VarU` represent the expected value and the variance of the Mann-Whitney U statistic, respectively. The standard score `z` is calculated based on the observed `Umin`, the expected value `EU`, and the variance `VarU`. Finally, the cumulative probability of `z` is computed using a standard normal distribution, and it is doubled to get the p-value.\n\nNow that we have reviewed the relevant code snippets, let's summarize the issue and suggest possible fixes.\n\nTitle: Failure in test `testBigDataSet` of `MannWhitneyUTest`\nDetails: The test `testBigDataSet` in the class `MannWhitneyUTest` fails when asserting that the calculated Mann-Whitney U statistic (`result`) is larger than 0.1. The failure occurs in the line 113 of the test case. Upon investigation, the failure seems to be caused by incorrect calculations in the methods `mannWhitneyU` and `calculateAsymptoticPValue`.\n\nTo fix the issue, we suggest the following:\n\n1. In the `mannWhitneyU` method:\n   - Ensure that the `ensureDataConformance` method is correctly validating the input arrays `x` and `y`.\n   - Verify the correctness of the concatenation of the arrays `x` and `y` into `z`.\n   - Check if the ranks are calculated accurately using the `naturalRanking.rank` method.\n\n2. In the `calculateAsymptoticPValue` method:\n   - Confirm the correctness of the calculations for `EU` (expected value) and `VarU` (variance) of the Mann-Whitney U statistic.\n   - Ensure that the computation of the standard score `z` is correct based on the observed `Umin`, `EU`, and `VarU`.\n   - Validate if the calculation of the cumulative probability using the standard normal distribution is accurate.\n\nPlease note that these suggestions are based on the code snippets and assumptions made during the investigation. Further analysis and debugging might be required to identify the exact cause of the failure and provide more accurate fixes.\n\nLet me know if I can help you with anything else."
