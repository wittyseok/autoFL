It creates a dataset with increasing dimensions and calculates the correlation p-values. Based on the comments in the test, the p-values should diminish smoothly and vanish at a certain dimension.\n\nLooking at the code of the `getCorrelationPValues` method, we can see that it calculates the p-values for each pair of variables in the correlation matrix. It uses the formula `2 * (1 - tDistribution.cumulativeProbability(t))` to calculate the p-value, where `t` is calculated as `Math.abs(r * Math.sqrt((nObs - 2)/(1 - r * r)))`, and `r` is the correlation coefficient.\n\nHowever, there is no check for the sufficiency of the data in the `checkSufficientData` method. This method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the matrix does not have at least two columns and two rows. Since the dataset in the test has only one column, it fails the sufficiency check and throws an exception. This exception causes the test to fail.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Modify the `checkSufficientData` method in the `PearsonsCorrelation` class to allow datasets with one column.\n\nPossible fix:\n- `org.apache.commons.math.stat.correlation.PearsonsCorrelation.checkSufficientData(org.apache.commons.math.linear.RealMatrix)`"
