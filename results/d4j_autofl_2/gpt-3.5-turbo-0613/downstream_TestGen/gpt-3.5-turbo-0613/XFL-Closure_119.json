The test invokes the `testSame` method with the following JavaScript code snippet:\n\n```\ntry {\n  throw Error();\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log(e.name)\n}\n```\n\nThe failure is indicated by the following error message and call stack:\n\n```\njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Unexpected warning(s): JSC_UNDEFINED_NAME. e is never defined at testcode line 1 : 48\nJSC_UNDEFINED_NAME. e is never defined at testcode line 1 : 48 expected:<0> but was:<2>\n\tat com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilerTestCase.test(CompilerTestCase.java:895)\n\tat com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilerTestCase.test(CompilerTestCase.java:477)\n\tat com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilerTestCase.test(CompilerTestCase.java:403)\n\tat com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilerTestCase.test(CompilerTestCase.java:372)\n\tat com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilerTestCase.test(CompilerTestCase.java:360)\n\tat com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilerTestCase.testSame(CompilerTestCase.java:599)\n\tat com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckGlobalNamesTest.testGlobalCatch(CheckGlobalNamesTest.java:341)\n```\n\nBased on the error message, it seems that there is an unexpected warning related to the usage of the variable `e` in the JavaScript code snippet. The test expected no warnings, but encountered two warnings of type `JSC_UNDEFINED_NAME`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the variable `e` is properly defined before it is used in the catch block. Additionally, we may need to adjust the expectations of the test to account for the expected warnings.\n\nThe suggested location to fix this issue is:\n`com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckGlobalNamesTest.testGlobalCatch()`"
