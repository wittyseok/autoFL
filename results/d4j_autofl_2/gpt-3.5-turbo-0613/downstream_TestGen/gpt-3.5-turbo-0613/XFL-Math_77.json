The maximum value is returned as the L-infinity norm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the error in the test case and the call stack to understand the cause of the failure.\nThe failing test `SparseRealVectorTest.testBasicFunctions` is testing the `getLInfNorm()` method of the `OpenMapRealVector` class. The test case expects the L-infinity norm of a vector to be equal to 6.0. However, the actual value computed by `getLInfNorm()` is -3.0, which caused the test case to fail.\n\nThe error message from the test case indicates that the expected value is `<6.0>`, but the actual value is `<-3.0>`.\n\nLooking at the call stack, the failure occurred at line 968 of the `SparseRealVectorTest.testBasicFunctions` method.\n\nTo further investigate the cause of the failure, let's examine the input data and the vector construction in the test case."
