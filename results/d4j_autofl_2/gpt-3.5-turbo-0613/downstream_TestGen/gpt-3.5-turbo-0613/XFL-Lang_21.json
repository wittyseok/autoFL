The method `DateUtils.isSameLocalTime` is expected to check if the two calendar objects represent the same local time. \n\nHere's the code snippet for the `DateUtils.isSameLocalTime` method:\n\n```java\n258 :     public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {\n259 :         if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {\n260 :             throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"The date must not be null\");\n261 :         }\n262 :         return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&\n263 :                 cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&\n264 :                 cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&\n265 :                 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&\n266 :                 cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&\n267 :                 cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&\n268 :                 cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&\n269 :                 cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());\n270 :     }\n```\n\nThe method compares the values of different fields of the `cal1` and `cal2` objects to determine if they represent the same millisecond instant. If any of the fields are different or if the two calendars are not of the same type, the method returns `false`.\n\nSince the test failed with the error message \"LANG-677\", it indicates that the `DateUtils.isSameLocalTime` method returned `false` when it was expected to return `true` for the given `cal3` and `cal4` objects. \n\nTo fix the issue, we need to check the implementation of the `DateUtils.isSameLocalTime` method and verify if it correctly handles the comparison of the calendar fields.\nThe bug occurs in the `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtils.isSameLocalTime` method. The method compares the values of various fields of the `Calendar` objects `cal1` and `cal2` to determine if they represent the same millisecond instant. However, the test failure indicates that the method is returning `false` when it should be returning `true` for the `cal3` and `cal4` objects passed in the test.\n\nTo fix the bug, we need to investigate why the comparison of the calendar fields is resulting in a false value for the given `cal3` and `cal4` objects.\n\nThe possible locations to fix this bug are:\n```\norg.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(java.util.Calendar, java.util.Calendar)\n```"
