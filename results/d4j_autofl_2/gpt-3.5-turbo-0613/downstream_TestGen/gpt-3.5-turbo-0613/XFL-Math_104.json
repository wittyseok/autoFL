The relevant methods are:\n- `regularizedGammaP(double, double)` at line 117\n- `regularizedGammaQ(double, double)` at line 197\n\nBased on the method signatures, it seems that these methods are related to the regularized gamma function, which is used to compute the normalized lower or upper incomplete gamma function.\n\nTo gather more information, I retrieved the code snippets for the `regularizedGammaP()` and `regularizedGammaQ()` methods. Here are the snippets:\n\n```java\nregularizedGammaP(double a, double x) {\n    return regularizedGammaP(a, x, DEFAULT_EPSILON, Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n}\n\nregularizedGammaQ(double a, double x) {\n    return regularizedGammaQ(a, x, DEFAULT_EPSILON, Integer.MAX_VALUE);\n}\n```\n\nFrom the code snippets, it appears that these methods are simply delegating the computation to other methods, passing in default values for the epsilon and maximum iterations.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the issue may be with the computation of the regularized gamma function itself, rather than the test case. To confirm this, we would need to investigate the implementation of the `regularizedGammaP()` and `regularizedGammaQ()` methods.\n\nPlease let me know what steps I should take next."
