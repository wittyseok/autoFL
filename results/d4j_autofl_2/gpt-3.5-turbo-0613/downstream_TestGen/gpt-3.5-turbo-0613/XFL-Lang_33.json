The test failed due to a `NullPointerException` in line 910 of the `toClass` method.\n\nThe code snippet for the `toClass` method is as follows:\n\n```java\n902 :     public static Class<?>[] toClass(Object[] array) {\n903 :         if (array == null) {\n904 :             return null;\n905 :         } else if (array.length == 0) {\n906 :             return ArrayUtils.EMPTY_CLASS_ARRAY;\n907 :         }\n908 :         Class<?>[] classes = new Class[array.length];\n909 :         for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n910 :             classes[i] = array[i].getClass(); // error occurred here\n911 :         }\n912 :         return classes;\n913 :     }\n```\n\nIn line 910, the method tries to get the class of each element in the `array` using the `getClass` method. However, a `NullPointerException` occurs because one of the elements in the `array` is `null`.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to handle the `null` elements in the `array` before calling the `getClass` method.\n\nSuggested fix:\n```\norg.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils.toClass(java.lang.Object[])\n```"

The first test, `testReproducesBug()`, should be a test that is different from the one that was initially presented to you, but should still reproduce the bug, based on your understanding of the bug. The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
