The specific error messages are:\n\n1. JSC_MSG_NOT_INITIALIZED_USING_NEW_SYNTAX: The message was not initialized using `goog.getMsg` at input0 line 1 : 28.\n2. JSC_MSG_TREE_MALFORMED: The message parse tree is malformed. Cannot parse the value of the message `MSG_FOO` at input0 line 1 : 38.\n\nThe call stack shows that the failing test method was called at line 395 of the `CommandLineRunnerTest` class.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that there is an issue related to the initialization and parsing of messages using `goog.getMsg`. The test expects no errors or warnings, but two specific errors occurred related to the initialization and parsing of a message named `MSG_FOO`.\n\nTo fix this bug, we should investigate the implementation of the `testGetMsgWiringNoWarnings` method in the `CommandLineRunnerTest` class and identify the code responsible for the incorrect initialization and parsing of the message `MSG_FOO`.\nThe bug occurred in the `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunnerTest.testGetMsgWiringNoWarnings()` method.\n\nTo fix the bug, the implementation of the `testGetMsgWiringNoWarnings` method in the `CommandLineRunnerTest` class needs to be modified to correctly initialize and parse the message `MSG_FOO`."
