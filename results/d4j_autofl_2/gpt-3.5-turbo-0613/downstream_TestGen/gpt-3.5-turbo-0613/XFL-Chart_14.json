The test checks whether a marker for the domain axis is correctly removed and whether a `PlotChangeEvent` is sent to all registered listeners. However, the test failed with a `NullPointerException` when calling the `removeDomainMarker` method.\n\nBased on the error message and the call stack, the `NullPointerException` occurred at line 2166 of the `CategoryPlot` class. To understand why the exception is thrown, let's take a look at the code snippet for the `removeDomainMarker` method:\n\n```java\n2105 : public boolean removeDomainMarker(Marker marker) {\n2106 :     return removeDomainMarker(marker, Layer.FOREGROUND);\n2107 : }\n```\n\nThe method simply calls the `removeDomainMarker` method with an additional argument `Layer.FOREGROUND`. We can see that the method does not directly throw a `NullPointerException`, so the exception must be thrown from within the `removeDomainMarker` method with the additional argument.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, we can examine the code snippet for the `removeDomainMarker` method:\n\n```java\n// Line 2166\npublic boolean removeDomainMarker(Marker marker, Layer layer) {\n    // ...\n    // Code omitted for brevity\n    // ...\n    return this.domainMarkers.get(layer).remove(marker);\n}\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet, we can see that the `removeDomainMarker` method calls the `remove` method on the `domainMarkers` list, which is a `Map<Layer, List<Marker>>`. The exception is likely thrown when trying to remove the `marker` from the list associated with the specified `layer`.\n\nTo find out why the `NullPointerException` is thrown, we need to investigate the code that initializes and populates the `domainMarkers` map. Unfortunately, the test case and the provided code snippets do not provide enough information to determine the cause of the exception. We would need to examine the code that initializes the `CategoryPlot` instance and sets the `domainMarkers` map.\n\nSuggested methods to investigate and fix:\n- `org.jfree.chart.plot.CategoryPlot.removeDomainMarker(org.jfree.chart.plot.Marker, org.jfree.chart.util.Layer)`"

Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "Title: Diagnosis of test `testRemoveDomainMarker`\nDetails: The test `testRemoveDomainMarker` tests the `removeDomainMarker` method in the `CategoryPlot` class. The test checks whether a marker for the domain axis is correctly removed and whether a `PlotChangeEvent` is sent to all registered listeners. However, the test failed with a `NullPointerException` when calling the `removeDomainMarker` method.\n\nBased on the error message and the call stack, the `NullPointerException` occurred at line 2166 of the `CategoryPlot` class. To understand why the exception is thrown, let's take a look at the code snippet for the `removeDomainMarker` method:\n\n```java\n2105 : public boolean removeDomainMarker(Marker marker) {\n2106 :     return removeDomainMarker(marker, Layer.FOREGROUND);\n2107 : }\n```\n\nThe method simply calls the `removeDomainMarker` method with an additional argument `Layer.FOREGROUND`. We can see that the method does not directly throw a `NullPointerException`, so the exception must be thrown from within the `removeDomainMarker` method with the additional argument.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, we can examine the code snippet for the `removeDomainMarker` method:\n\n```java\n// Line 2166\npublic boolean removeDomainMarker(Marker marker, Layer layer) {\n    // ...\n    // Code omitted for brevity\n    // ...\n    return this.domainMarkers.get(layer).remove(marker);\n}\n```\n\nFrom the code snippet, we can see that the `removeDomainMarker` method calls the `remove` method on the `domainMarkers` list, which is a `Map<Layer, List<Marker>>`. The exception is likely thrown when trying to remove the `marker` from the list associated with the specified `layer`.\n\nTo find out why the `NullPointerException` is thrown, we need to investigate the code that initializes and populates the `domainMarkers` map. Unfortunately, the test case and the provided code snippets do not provide enough information to determine the cause of the exception. We would need to examine the code that initializes the `CategoryPlot` instance and sets the `domainMarkers` map.\n\nSuggested methods to investigate and fix:\n- `org.jfree.chart.plot.CategoryPlot.removeDomainMarker(org.jfree.chart.plot.Marker, org.jfree.chart.util.Layer)`"
