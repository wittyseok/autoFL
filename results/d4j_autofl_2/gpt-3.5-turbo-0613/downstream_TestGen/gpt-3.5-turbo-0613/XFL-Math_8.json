It takes an `int` parameter `sampleSize` which indicates the number of random values to generate. The method returns an array representing the random sample.\n\nIf the `sampleSize` parameter is not positive, the method throws a `NotStrictlyPositiveException`.\n\nUnfortunately, the code comment does not provide any hints about the cause of the `ArrayStoreException` that occurred in the test `DiscreteRealDistributionTest.testIssue942`.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, we might need to examine other parts of the codebase or gather more information.\nBased on the analysis of the failing test and the code snippets provided, here is a summary of the situation:\n\n- The test `DiscreteRealDistributionTest.testIssue942` failed with an `ArrayStoreException` in the `DiscreteDistribution.sample` method.\n- The test creates a `List<Pair<Object,Double>>` and passes it to the `DiscreteDistribution` constructor.\n- The `DiscreteDistribution.sample` method is called with an argument of 1, and the length of the returned array is checked against an expected value of 1.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the issue lies within the `DiscreteDistribution` class in its handling of the `List<Pair<Object,Double>>` parameter passed to its constructor.\n\nNext, I will provide suggestions on which methods in the codebase might need to be fixed."

The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
