This means that if `that` is not an instance of `RecordType`, the `getLeastSupertype` method should return the least supertype provided by the superclass.\n\nIf `that` is an instance of `RecordType`, the method creates a new `RecordTypeBuilder` and iterates over the properties of the current `RecordType`.

If it is not, it delegates the operation to the superclass implementation by calling `super.getLeastSupertype(that)`. This means that if `that` is not an instance of `RecordType`, the `getLeastSupertype` method should return the least supertype provided by the superclass.\n\nIf `that` is an instance of `RecordType`, the method creates a new `RecordTypeBuilder` and iterates over the properties of the current `RecordType`. For each property, it checks if the `that` instance also has the same property and if the types of the properties are equivalent. If these conditions are met, the property is added to the builder with the corresponding type and node.\n\nFinally, the method returns the `RecordType` created by the builder.\n\nBased on the error message and the code snippet of the `getLeastSupertype` method, it seems that the `that` parameter passed to the method is not an instance of `RecordType`. This could explain why the method does not return the expected `UnionType`.\n\nTo further diagnose the issue, we need to inspect the code where the `getLeastSupertype` method is called. Please provide the code snippet that contains the invocation of the `getLeastSupertype` method."

Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."
