The test checks whether a high unicode character is correctly escaped to its HTML representation, but the test failure indicates that this is not the case. The actual result contains additional escape codes, while the expected result does not.\n\nBy examining the code of the `StringEscapeUtils` class, we find that the `escapeHtml` method (which is called in the test) escapes HTML entities in a string.

However, the code does not handle high unicode characters correctly.\n\nSimilarly, the `unescapeHtml` method in the `StringEscapeUtils` class (lines 524-536) takes a string as input and unescapes any HTML entities present in the string.
