However, the `appendFixedWidthPadRight` method throws a `NullPointerException` because it attempts to call the `toString` method on the `null` object at line 1229.\n\nLooking at the `appendFixedWidthPadRight` method, we can see that it first checks if the `width` parameter is greater than 0. If it is, it proceeds to append the object to the `StrBuilder`. However, before doing so, it calls the `toString` method on the `obj` parameter, which can be `null`. In this case, it uses the `getNullText` method to retrieve the text to be appended when `null` is added.\n\nThe `getNullText` method simply returns the `nullText` field, which is not initialized in the `StrBuilder` class. Therefore, when `null` is passed to the `appendFixedWidthPadRight` method, an attempt to call `toString` on `null` is made, resulting in a `NullPointerException`.\n\nSuggestions for fixes:\n- Initialize the `nullText` field in the `StrBuilder` class to a default value or handle `null` values in the `appendFixedWidthPadRight` method.\n\nNote: It might also be worth considering whether the `appendFixedWidthPadRight` method should throw an exception when `null` is passed rather than relying on the `nullText` field.\n\nNext, let's retrieve the code snippet for the `getNullText` method to get a better understanding of its implementation.\nThe best locations to be fixed in this case are:\n\norg.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder.appendFixedWidthPadRight(java.lang.Object, int, char)\norg.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder.getNullText()"

The first test, `testReproducesBug()`, should be a test that is different from the one that was initially presented to you, but should still reproduce the bug, based on your understanding of the bug. The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug. Please answer in the format:\n\n```java\npublic void testReproducesBug() {\n    (failing test content)\n}\n\npublic void testSimilarButPasses() {\n    (passing test content)\n}\n```\n\nYour answer will be processed automatically, so do not include any commentary.
