However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.

However, if other objects have already been added, the value being added must be comparable to the existing values. If the value is not comparable, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with the message \"Value not comparable to existing values.\"\n\nIn this case, the test case is calling the `.addValue` method with a non-comparable object. This causes the `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown. However, the test case does not catch the exception and assert the expected behavior, leading to a test failure.\n\n## Suggestions for fixing the test:\nTo fix the test, the test case should include an assertion to verify that the expected `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when adding a non-comparable object.\n\n## Suggestions for fixing the code:\nTo fix the underlying issue, the code should be modified to only allow adding comparable objects to the `Frequency` class. This can be done by updating the `.addValue` method to accept a `Comparable` object instead of an `Object`. By doing so, the method can ensure that only comparable values are added. Additionally, the JavaDoc documentation of the method should also be updated to reflect this change.\n\nSuggested fixes:\n- `org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest.testAddNonComparable()`\n- `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(java.lang.Comparable)`"
