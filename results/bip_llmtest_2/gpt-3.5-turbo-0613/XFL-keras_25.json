You will be presented with a failing test, and tools (functions) to access the source code of the system under test (SUT). Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The test `['tests.keras.applications.imagenet_utils_test.test_preprocess_input()']` failed.\nThe test looks like:\n\n```python\n10 : def test_preprocess_input():\n11 :     # Test image batch with float and int image input\n12 :     x = np.random.uniform(0, 255, (2, 10, 10, 3))\n13 :     xint = x.astype('int32')\n14 :     assert utils.preprocess_input(x).shape == x.shape\n15 :     assert utils.preprocess_input(xint).shape == xint.shape # error occurred here\n```\n\nIt failed with the following error message and call stack:\n\n```\nE           numpy.core._exceptions._UFuncOutputCastingError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'\n>       assert utils.preprocess_input(xint).shape == xint.shape\ntests/keras/applications/imagenet_utils_test.py:15: \nkeras/applications/imagenet_utils.py:178: in preprocess_input\nkeras/applications/imagenet_utils.py:178: in preprocess_input\n    return _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format=data_format, mode=mode)\n\n>           x[..., 0] -= mean[0]\nkeras/applications/imagenet_utils.py:82: UFuncTypeError\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/h5py/__init__.py:46: DeprecationWarning: `np.typeDict` is a deprecated alias for `np.sctypeDict`.\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py:15: DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module's documentation for alternative uses\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/nest.py:1286: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/nest.py:1287: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:516: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:517: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:518: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:519: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:520: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:525: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n  /opt/conda/envs/70d512a17e79e7668f22d8292a6a3870/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:593: DeprecationWarning: `np.object` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `object`.
