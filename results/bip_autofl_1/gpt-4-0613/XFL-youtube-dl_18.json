Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

It seems to retain the 'id' of the original extractor (Foo1IE in this case) instead of updating it as it is processed by subsequent extractors. \n\nGiven the available information, my diagnosis is that the problem likely exists in the methods called upon within the `extract_info` method in the YoutubeDL class, or the `_real_extract` method within the InfoExtractor class.\nUnfortunately without access to the source code of these methods it's hard to pinpoint the exact location of the bug. \n\nThe user would need to inspect these methods, specially how they handle the 'id' field when processing 'url_transparent' and 'url' type entries through subsequent info extractor calls. They would need to investigate if there is any condition which prevents the update of 'id' field when it should be updated."
