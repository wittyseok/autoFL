            "content": "The test `test_stacked_rnn_compute_output_shape` fails because the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class does not correctly calculate the output shape when stacked RNN cells are used. According to the source code of the `RNN` class, the output shape is determined by the dimensions of the first RNN cell in the stack (lines 397-398). However, the test expects the output shape to reflect the dimensions of all cells.\n\nIn the test, a `RNN` layer is created with a list of `LSTMCell` objects of dimensions 3 and 6 (line 602), and the `return_state` parameter is set to `True`. The computed `output_shape` should thus incorporate information from both `LSTMCell` objects in the list. The output shape of the test is `[(None, timesteps, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 3), (None, 3)]` (line 605). However, the current implementation of `compute_output_shape` only uses the size of the first cell for the computation of the state shape size (line 408), thus not including the shape of the second LSTM cell. As a result, the output shape incorrectly has the value `6` instead of `3` for the 4th and 5th items of the list.\nThis discrepancy is what leads to the assertion error on line 610 of the test.\n\nTo better understand the problem, we can look at how the `state_shape` variable is computed in the `compute_output_shape` function:\n```python\nstate_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]\n```\n`output_dim` is computed based on the `state_size` of `self.cell` which only reflects the state size of the first LSTMCell in the list. Thus, the `state_shape` list will contain `(None, 6)` at both the 4th and 5th position instead of `(None, 3)`."

According to the source code of the `RNN` class, the output shape is determined by the dimensions of the first RNN cell in the stack (lines 397-398). However, the test expects the output shape to reflect the dimensions of all cells.\n\nIn the test, a `RNN` layer is created with a list of `LSTMCell` objects of dimensions 3 and 6 (line 602), and the `return_state` parameter is set to `True`. The computed `output_shape` should thus incorporate information from both `LSTMCell` objects in the list. The output shape of the test is `[(None, timesteps, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 3), (None, 3)]` (line 605). However, the current implementation of `compute_output_shape` only uses the size of the first cell for the computation of the state shape size (line 408), thus not including the shape of the second LSTM cell. As a result, the output shape incorrectly has the value `6` instead of `3` for the 4th and 5th items of the list.\nThis discrepancy is what leads to the assertion error on line 610 of the test.\n\nTo better understand the problem, we can look at how the `state_shape` variable is computed in the `compute_output_shape` function:\n```python\nstate_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]\n```\n`output_dim` is computed based on the `state_size` of `self.cell` which only reflects the state size of the first LSTMCell in the list. Thus, the `state_shape` list will contain `(None, 6)` at both the 4th and 5th position instead of `(None, 3)`."
