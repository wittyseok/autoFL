It shows that the output received was `(None, 6)` whereas the expected value was `(None, 3)`. \n\nThe `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class is identified in the traceback as the source code that is covered by the failing test. Looking at its implementation, the method takes an `input_shape` and computes the `output_shape` based on this. \n\nAccording to the code, if `return_state` is `True`, which is the case in the failing test, the method returns `output_shape` with additional `state_shape`. The `state_shape` is computed as a list of shapes `(input_shape[0], output_dim)` for each state.\n\nHowever, the discrepancy appears to arise from how the `output_dim` (dimension of the output) is computed. The `output_dim` is intended to be the first state size dimensions of the cell. In the test, the cell has two LSTMCells with 3 and 6 dimensions respectively, and it seems like the `output_dim` has taken the last LSTMCell for computing `output_dim`, rather than the first as designed.\n\nThe next step would be verification if the creation of `cells` and `layer` objects in the test is done correctly and if the `RNN` class is indeed designed to take the first LSTMCell dimensions. The appropriate fixes can then be suggested based on these observations. For now, the `RNN.compute_output_shape` method seems to be the potential location of the error."

It shows that the output received was `(None, 6)` whereas the expected value was `(None, 3)`. \n\nThe `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class is identified in the traceback as the source code that is covered by the failing test. Looking at its implementation, the method takes an `input_shape` and computes the `output_shape` based on this. \n\nAccording to the code, if `return_state` is `True`, which is the case in the failing test, the method returns `output_shape` with additional `state_shape`. The `state_shape` is computed as a list of shapes `(input_shape[0], output_dim)` for each state.\n\nHowever, the discrepancy appears to arise from how the `output_dim` (dimension of the output) is computed. The `output_dim` is intended to be the first state size dimensions of the cell. In the test, the cell has two LSTMCells with 3 and 6 dimensions respectively, and it seems like the `output_dim` has taken the last LSTMCell for computing `output_dim`, rather than the first as designed.\n\nThe next step would be verification if the creation of `cells` and `layer` objects in the test is done correctly and if the `RNN` class is indeed designed to take the first LSTMCell dimensions. The appropriate fixes can then be suggested based on these observations. For now, the `RNN.compute_output_shape` method seems to be the potential location of the error."
