However, the test failure indicates that the lower bound is being considered inclusive when it should not be.\n\nBy inspecting the code of the `FDistribution` class, we can see that the `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive` method always returns `true`. This means that the lower bound is always considered inclusive, which contradicts the assertion in the test. Additionally, the `density` method and the `getSupportLowerBound` method do not seem to be relevant to the issue.\n\nSuggested fix:\n\n- Modify the `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive` method in the `FDistribution` class to return the correct value.\n\n```java\npublic boolean isSupportLowerBoundInclusive() {\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this fix assumes that the lower bound should not be inclusive.
