The method `convertByWeekyear()` in the `GJChronology` class is modified to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when the `weekyear` argument is less than or equal to 0. This will handle the case where the weekyear is 0 and prevent the exception in the original code.\n2. The method `plusWeeks()` in the `LocalDate` class is modified to handle the case where the new weeks value is less than 1 or greater than the weeks in the year. In such cases, it adjusts the date to the start of the week and calculates the new year and week values accordingly. This ensures that the date remains valid after adding the given number of weeks.",
