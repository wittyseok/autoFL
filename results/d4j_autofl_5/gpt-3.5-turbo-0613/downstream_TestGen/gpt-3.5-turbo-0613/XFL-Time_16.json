However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "The `withDefaultYear` method of the `DateTimeFormatter` class returns a new formatter that will use the specified default year. This default year is used when parsing in cases where there is a month or a day, but not a year. It is specifically used if there is a field parsed with a duration between the length of a month and the length of a day, inclusive. The purpose of this default year is typically to handle cases where February 29th needs to be parsed. By default, if no default year is specified, the year 2000 is used.\n\nBased on this information, let's analyze the failing test `testParseInto_monthDay_withDefaultYear_feb29` and the error message it produces.\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testParseInto_monthDay_withDefaultYear_feb29`\nDetails: The test `testParseInto_monthDay_withDefaultYear_feb29` is testing the behavior of the `DateTimeFormatter.parseInto` method in the `org.joda.time.format` package. The test is parsing a month and day using a formatter with a default year of 2012. The expected result is a `MutableDateTime` object representing February 29th, 2004 in the London timezone. However, the actual result is a `MutableDateTime` object representing February 29th, 2012 in the London timezone. This indicates that the `withDefaultYear` method is not correctly setting the default year for parsing.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, let's retrieve the code snippet for the `withDefaultYear` method of the `DateTimeFormatter` class."
