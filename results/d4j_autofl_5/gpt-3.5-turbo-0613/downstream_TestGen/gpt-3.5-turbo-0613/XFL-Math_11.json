Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "The `MultivariateNormalDistribution` class has a constructor that takes an array of means and a matrix of covariances as input. Here is the code snippet for the constructor:\n\n```java\n71 : public MultivariateNormalDistribution(final double[] means,\n72 :                                       final double[][] covariances)\n73 :     throws SingularMatrixException,\n74 :            DimensionMismatchException,\n75 :            NonPositiveDefiniteMatrixException {\n76 :     this(new Well19937c(), means, covariances);\n77 : }\n```\n\nThe constructor initializes a `MultivariateNormalDistribution` object using a default random generator (`Well19937c`) and the given means and covariances. \n\nFrom the failing test, we can see that the means array (`mu`) is `[-1.5]` and the covariances matrix (`sigma`) is `[[1]]`. There doesn't seem to be any issue with the input values.\n\nGiven this information, the bug may be related to the calculation of the covariance matrix or the random number generator used to generate the random values. I would suggest investigating the following methods for potential fixes:\n\n1. `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.MultivariateNormalDistribution.MultivariateNormalDistribution(double[], double[][])`\n2. `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.MultivariateNormalDistribution.getExponentTerm(double[])`\n3. `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.MultivariateNormalDistribution.getMeans()`"
