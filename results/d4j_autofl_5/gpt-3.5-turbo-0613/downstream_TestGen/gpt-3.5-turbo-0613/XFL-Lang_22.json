The method first checks if the `denominator` is zero and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it is. Then, it checks if the `numerator` is zero and returns a pre-defined constant `ZERO` if it is. Next, it checks if the `denominator` is equal to `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and the `numerator` is even. In this case, it divides both the `numerator` and the `denominator` by 2. Then, it checks if the `denominator` is negative. If it is, it checks if either the `numerator` or the `denominator` is equal to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. If so, it throws an `ArithmeticException` for overflow. Afterwards, it converts the `denominator` to a positive value by negating both the `numerator` and the `denominator`. Finally, it computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the `numerator` and the `denominator` using the `greatestCommonDivisor` method and divides both the `numerator` and the `denominator` by the GCD. The method then creates a new `Fraction` object with the simplified numerator and denominator and returns it.\n\nThe error occurred on line 336 of the test method, which calls the `getReducedFraction` method with `Integer.MIN_VALUE` as the numerator and 2 as the denominator. The test expected the numerator of the returned `Fraction` object to be `Integer.MIN_VALUE / 2`, but the actual value was `-2147483648`. This indicates that the `getReducedFraction` method did not correctly reduce the fraction.\n\nTo further investigate, we can look at the `reduce` method of the `Fraction` class. This method is called by the `getReducedFraction` method to simplify the fraction. The `reduce` method first checks if the numerator is zero and returns either the current fraction if it is equal to zero or a pre-defined constant `ZERO`. Then, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute values of the numerator and the denominator using the `greatestCommonDivisor` method. If the GCD is 1, indicating that the numerator and the denominator are already relatively prime, the method returns the current fraction. Otherwise, it creates a new `Fraction` object with the numerator divided by the GCD and the denominator divided by the GCD and returns it.\n\nTo dive deeper, let's examine the `greatestCommonDivisor` method of the `Fraction` class. This private method calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `u` and `v`. It starts by checking if either `u` or `v` is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it returns 1 as the GCD. Then, it proceeds to handle negative values of `u` and `v` by making them both negative. Next, it calculates the power of 2 that `u` and `v` have in common and divides both by 2 until they are both odd. After that, it repeatedly applies the Euclidean algorithm by continuously dividing the larger value by the difference of the values divided by 2 until the difference is 0. Finally, it returns the negation of `u` multiplied by 2 raised to the power of the number of times it divided by 2.\n\nBased on the code inspection, it appears that the bug may be related to the `greatestCommonDivisor` method not correctly calculating the GCD, which in turn affects the simplification of fractions in the `reduce` method and the `getReducedFraction` method.\n\nTo fix the bug, we need to investigate and modify the `greatestCommonDivisor` method to ensure that it correctly calculates the GCD.

The first test, `testReproducesBug()`, should be a test that is different from the one that was initially presented to you, but should still reproduce the bug, based on your understanding of the bug. The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug. Please answer in the format:\n\n```java\npublic void testReproducesBug() {\n    (failing test content)\n}\n\npublic void testSimilarButPasses() {\n    (passing test content)\n}\n```\n\nYour answer will be processed automatically, so do not include any commentary.
