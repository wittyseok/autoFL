The test adds two data points to the series, but an error occurs while adding the second data point.\n\nFrom the test failure traceback, we can see that the error occurs in the `XYSeries.addOrUpdate` method at line 564. The method `addOrUpdate` is called with two `double` values as parameters. Looking at the code snippet of the `addOrUpdate` method, we can see that it internally delegates to another overloaded `addOrUpdate` method that takes `Number` objects as parameters. This overloaded method is called at line 527.\n\nIn the overloaded `addOrUpdate` method, there is a check for duplicate X values. It first tries to find the index of the given X value in the series using the `indexOf` method. If the index is greater than or equal to 0 and the series does not allow duplicate X values, it overwrites the corresponding Y value. Otherwise, it adds the new data point to the series at the correct position based on the X value and removes the oldest data point if the maximum item count is exceeded.\n\nThe error occurs because the index returned by the `indexOf` method is -1, indicating that the given X value is not found in the series. However, the code incorrectly assumes that a negative index means the X value should be inserted at that index. This leads to an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to add the new data point at index -1.\n\nTo fix the error, the code should handle the case of a negative index correctly by adjusting the insertion position when the series is not sorted.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Class: org.jfree.data.xy.XYSeries\n- Method: addOrUpdate(Number x, Number y)\n"

Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The test adds two data points to the series, but an error occurs while adding the second data point.\n\nFrom the test failure traceback, we can see that the error occurs in the `XYSeries.addOrUpdate` method at line 564. The method `addOrUpdate` is called with two `double` values as parameters. Looking at the code snippet of the `addOrUpdate` method, we can see that it internally delegates to another overloaded `addOrUpdate` method that takes `Number` objects as parameters. This overloaded method is called at line 527.\n\nIn the overloaded `addOrUpdate` method, there is a check for duplicate X values. It first tries to find the index of the given X value in the series using the `indexOf` method. If the index is greater than or equal to 0 and the series does not allow duplicate X values, it overwrites the corresponding Y value. Otherwise, it adds the new data point to the series at the correct position based on the X value and removes the oldest data point if the maximum item count is exceeded.\n\nThe error occurs because the index returned by the `indexOf` method is -1, indicating that the given X value is not found in the series. However, the code incorrectly assumes that a negative index means the X value should be inserted at that index. This leads to an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to add the new data point at index -1.\n\nTo fix the error, the code should handle the case of a negative index correctly by adjusting the insertion position when the series is not sorted.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Class: org.jfree.data.xy.XYSeries\n- Method: addOrUpdate(Number x, Number y)\n"
