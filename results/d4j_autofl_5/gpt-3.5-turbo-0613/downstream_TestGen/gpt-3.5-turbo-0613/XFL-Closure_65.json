The incorrect formatting of the output in the failing test indicates that there may be a bug in the parsing or formatting logic of the `CodePrinter` class.\n\nTo fix the bug, the following method can be considered for modification:\n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.parsePrint(java.lang.String, boolean, int)`\n\nPlease note that further investigation, including reviewing the implementation details and documentation, may be required to provide a more accurate and specific fix suggestion."
