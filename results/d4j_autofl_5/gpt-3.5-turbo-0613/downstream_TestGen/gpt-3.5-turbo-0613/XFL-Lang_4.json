However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The test checks the `translate` method in the `LookupTranslator` class, which is used to translate a `CharSequence` input to a `Writer` using a lookup map.\n\nBy examining the code of the `lookup` method, we can see that it iterates over the input `CharSequence` from the maximum length (`longest`) to the minimum length (`shortest`). It checks if the current subsequence exists in the lookup map and writes the corresponding result to the output `Writer`. If a match is found, it returns the length of the matched subsequence.\n\nThe failure occurred on line 48 in the test code, where it expected the output `result` to have a length of 3, but it actually had a length of 0. This suggests that the lookup map did not contain the expected subsequence.\n\nIt seems that the lookup map was not initialized correctly in the constructor (`LookupTranslator(CharSequence[]...)`). The constructor takes a variable number of `CharSequence` arrays as input, where each array represents a key-value pair in the lookup map. The constructor initializes the map (`lookupMap`) with the provided key-value pairs and determines the `shortest` and `longest` lengths based on the keys.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to investigate why the lookup map is not being initialized correctly.\nThe bug seems to be in the `LookupTranslator` constructor, specifically in the logic that initializes the `lookupMap` and determines the `shortest` and `longest` lengths. To fix the bug, the following method should be modified:\n\n`org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.LookupTranslator.<init>(java.lang.CharSequence[]...)`\n\nAdditionally, since the failure occurred in the `translate` method, we should also investigate and potentially fix any issues in that method:\n\n`org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.LookupTranslator.translate(java.lang.CharSequence, int, java.io.Writer)`\n\nPlease note that the suggested methods are based on the information provided and may require further investigation to fully address the bug."
