Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "The `addData` method in the `SimpleRegression` class is implemented as follows:\n\n```java\npublic void addData(double x, double y) {\n    if (n == 0) {\n        xbar = x;\n        ybar = y;\n    } else {\n        double dx = x - xbar;\n        double dy = y - ybar;\n        sumXX += dx * dx * (double) n / (double) (n + 1.0);\n        sumYY += dy * dy * (double) n / (double) (n + 1.0);\n        sumXY += dx * dy * (double) n / (double) (n + 1.0);\n        xbar += dx / (double) (n + 1.0);\n        ybar += dy / (double) (n + 1.0);\n    }\n    sumX += x;\n    sumY += y;\n    n++;\n}\n```\n\nThe `addData` method is responsible for accumulating and updating the variables `sumXX`, `sumYY`, `sumXY`, `xbar`, and `ybar` based on the input `x` and `y` values. It also tracks the total sum of `x`, the total sum of `y`, and the count of data points `n`.\n\nTo compute the updated values of `sumXX`, `sumYY`, `sumXY`, `xbar`, and `ybar`, the method uses the formulas:\n\n```\nsumXX += dx * dx * (double) n / (double) (n + 1.0);\nsumYY += dy * dy * (double) n / (double) (n + 1.0);\nsumXY += dx * dy * (double) n / (double) (n + 1.0);\nxbar += dx / (double) (n + 1.0);\nybar += dy / (double) (n + 1.0);\n```\n\nwhere `dx` and `dy` are the differences between `x` and `xbar`, and between `y` and `ybar`, respectively.\n\nBased on the implementation of the `addData` method, it appears that the accumulation and updating of the variables are correctly done. Therefore, the issue might lie with the formula used in the `getSumSquaredErrors` method itself.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we should review the formula `SSE = SYY - (SXY * SXY / SXX)` and ensure its correctness.\nBased on the analysis of the code and test failure, it seems that the issue lies with the formula used in the `getSumSquaredErrors` method of the `SimpleRegression` class. The formula `SSE = SYY - (SXY * SXY / SXX)` might not accurately represent the sum of squared errors, leading to incorrect results in the method.\n\nTo resolve the issue, I suggest modifying the formula in the `getSumSquaredErrors` method of the `SimpleRegression` class to ensure its correctness. This will involve revisiting the computational formula for calculating the sum of squared errors and making any necessary adjustments.\n\nTherefore, the location that needs to be fixed is:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression.getSumSquaredErrors()\n```"
