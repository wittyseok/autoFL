Then it checks if `lhs` and `rhs` are the same object reference, and if so, it also returns without performing any comparisons.\n\nIf either `lhs` or `rhs` is `null`, the method sets the `isEquals` flag to false and returns.\n\nNext, it checks if `lhs` is an array or not. If it's not an array, it simply compares `lhs` and `rhs` using the `equals` method.\n\nIf `lhs` is an array, it checks if `lhs` and `rhs` have different classes. If they have different classes, it sets the `isEquals` flag to false.\n\nFinally, if `lhs` is an array, it dispatches to a specific handler based on the array type (long, int, short, char, byte, double, float, boolean, or Object). This allows for comparing multi-dimensional arrays of the same depth.\n\nBased on the code snippet, the bug could potentially be caused by an incorrect comparison between different types of arrays (`lhs.getClass() != rhs.getClass()`), or by a missing handler for a specific array type in the `append` method.\n\nTo fix the bug, the comparison between array types (`lhs.getClass() != rhs.getClass()`) could be replaced with a more appropriate comparison method or condition. Additionally, if a specific array type does not have a corresponding handler, one should be added to properly compare the arrays.\n\nPlease note that I do not have access to the complete codebase and cannot provide precise fix locations."
