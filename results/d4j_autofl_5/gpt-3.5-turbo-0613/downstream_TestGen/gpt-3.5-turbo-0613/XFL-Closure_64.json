To understand the issue, we need to investigate the `toSource` method of the `Compiler` class.\n\nThe `toSource` method in the `Compiler` class converts the main parse tree back to JavaScript code. It uses a `CodeBuilder` to build the code. However, without access to the `CodeBuilder.toString` method's code snippet, we cannot determine the exact behavior that led to the unexpected index.\n\nTo find a possible fix for this issue, we can suggest looking into the following methods:\n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.toSource()` to ensure that the code building process correctly includes the `'use strict'` statement.\n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunnerTest.testES5StrictUseStrictMultipleInputs()` to verify the test case and its assertion.\n\nPlease note that these suggestions are based on the information available and further investigation may be required to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure."

The second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, should be a test that is syntactically similar to `testReproducesBug()`, such that it almost, but does _not_, trigger the bug.
