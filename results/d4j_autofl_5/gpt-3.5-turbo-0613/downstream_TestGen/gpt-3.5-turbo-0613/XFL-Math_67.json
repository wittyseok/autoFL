Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

It calls the `getResult`, `getOptima`, and `getOptimaValues` methods of the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class. \n\nThe `getResult` method, located at line 96, simply returns the result of calling the `getResult` method of the underlying optimizer. \n\nThe `getOptima` method, located at line 192, checks if the `optima` array is null and throws an `IllegalStateException` if it is. Otherwise, it clones and returns the `optima` array. \n\nThe `getOptimaValues` method, located at line 218, performs a similar check for the `optimaValues` array and throws an `IllegalStateException` if it is null. Otherwise, it clones and returns the `optimaValues` array.\n\nBased on the test failure, we can see that the expected result is `-0.27195612846834`, but the actual result is `-0.27194301946870036`. This indicates a small numerical discrepancy.\n\nTo suggest locations to fix, I would recommend looking into the implementation of the underlying optimizer's `getResult` method, as well as the computation of the `optima` and `optimaValues` arrays in the `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer` class."
