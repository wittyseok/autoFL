Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

These positions are expected to represent the start and end locations of the extracted text.\n\nBased on the error message and call stack, it seems that the positions passed to `markText` are incorrect. The error indicates that the \"Recorded bad position information\" occurred with a `start-char` of 14 and an `end-char` of 13.\n\nTo investigate further, we can examine the `startCharno` and `endCharno` values in the failing test case.\nIn the failing test case `testTextExtents`, the `parse` method is called with a JsDoc string \"@return {@code foo} bar \\n *    baz. */\". The error occurred on line 2756.\n\nTo gather more information about the `startCharno` and `endCharno` values, we can examine the code snippet where the `extractMultilineTextualBlock` method is called in the failing test."
