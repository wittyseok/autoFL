Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

                "content": "Here is the code snippet for the `getObject` method:\n\n```java\npublic Object getObject(Comparable rowKey, Comparable columnKey) {\n    if (rowKey == null) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Null 'rowKey' argument.\");\n    }\n    if (columnKey == null) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Null 'columnKey' argument.\");\n    }\n    int row = this.rowKeys.indexOf(rowKey);\n    if (row < 0) {\n        throw new UnknownKeyException(\"Row key (\" + rowKey\n                + \") not recognised.\");\n    }\n    int column = this.columnKeys.indexOf(columnKey);\n    if (column < 0) {\n        throw new UnknownKeyException(\"Column key (\" + columnKey\n                + \") not recognised.\");\n    }\n    if (row >= 0) {\n        KeyedObjects rowData = (KeyedObjects) this.rows.get(row);\n        return rowData.getObject(columnKey);\n    }\n    else {\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `getObject` method retrieves the object associated with the specified row key and column key from the `KeyedObjects2D` data structure. It first checks if the row key and column key are not null. Then, it searches for the indices of the row key and column key in their respective lists. If either key is not found, an `UnknownKeyException` is thrown with the corresponding message. If both keys are valid, it retrieves the `KeyedObjects` for the specified row and returns the object associated with the column key.\n\nBased on the failing test and the code snippets, it appears that the key \"C2\" is not recognized when calling the `getObject` method. This could be due to the `rowKey` or `columnKey` not being present in the `KeyedObjects2D` data structure. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the keys used in the `setObject` and `getObject` methods match.\n\nTo fix the bug, we should update the `testSetObject` method in the `KeyedObjects2DTests` class to use the correct row and column keys when setting and retrieving objects. The test should use the same row and column keys that are present in the `KeyedObjects2D` data structure."
