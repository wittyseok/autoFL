The test constructs a function `f` that creates a new instance of `externObjSEThis` and calls its `externObjSEThisMethod` method, and then invokes `f`. The expected behavior is that only the call to `externObjSEThis` is marked as a side effect.\n\nThe test failure indicates that the actual marked calls returned by the `checkMarkedCalls` method do not match the expected marked calls. The assertion `assertEquals(expected, noSideEffectCalls)` failed, with the expected marked calls being `[externObjSEThis]` and the actual marked calls being `[externObjSEThis, NEW STRING externObjSEThisMethod, f]`.\n\nBased on the code snippets, it appears that the `NEW STRING externObjSEThisMethod` and `f` calls should not be marked as side effects, as they are expected to be pure function calls. Therefore, the bug is likely in the `checkMarkedCalls` method, where the actual marked calls are determined.\n\nSuggestions for fixing the bug:\n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PureFunctionIdentifierTest.checkMarkedCalls(java.lang.String, java.util.List<java.lang.String>)`\n\nPlease note that the fix suggestion is based on the assumption that the issue lies in the `checkMarkedCalls` method. Further investigation and analysis may be required to confirm and address the bug correctly."
