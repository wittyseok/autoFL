It checks if the provided statement can be a valid statement, and then creates a new block node with the statement as its child. The `IR.tryCatch` method, on the other hand, expects the try body to be a block node.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the test is expecting the `IR.block` method to automatically convert a non-block statement to a block statement. However, this conversion is not happening, leading to the `IllegalStateException` when trying to create the try-catch statement.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Modify the `IR.tryCatch` method to check if the provided try body is not a block node and convert it to a block node if necessary.\nSuggested fixes:\n- `com.google.javascript.rhino.IR.tryCatch(com.google.javascript.rhino.Node, com.google.javascript.rhino.Node)`\n- `com.google.javascript.rhino.IR.block(com.google.javascript.rhino.Node)`"
