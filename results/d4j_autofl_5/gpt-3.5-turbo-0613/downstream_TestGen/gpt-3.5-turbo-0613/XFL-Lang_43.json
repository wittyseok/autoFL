The failing test `org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormatTest.testEscapedQuote_LANG_477()` is testing the `testEscapedQuote_LANG_477` method in the `ExtendedMessageFormatTest` class.\n2. In the test, the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class is instantiated with a pattern containing an escaped quote.\n3. The `ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor is called with the pattern and a registry.\n4. Inside the `ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor, the `applyPattern` method is called, passing the pattern as an argument.\n5. The `applyPattern` method starts by checking if the registry is `null`. If it is `null`, the method calls the `super.applyPattern` method and sets the `toPattern` field to the result.\n6. If the registry is not `null`, the method initializes some variables and starts processing the pattern character by character.\n7. When encountering a quote character (`'`), the method calls the `appendQuotedString` method to handle the quoted string.\n8. The `appendQuotedString` method checks if escaping is enabled and if the current character is a quote. If so, it returns the appendTo buffer with a single quote appended.\n9. If the escaping is not enabled or the current character is not a quote, the method iterates over the remaining characters in the pattern.\n10. If escaping is enabled and the next characters match the `ESCAPED_QUOTE` string, the method appends the characters between the lastHold position and the current position to the appendTo buffer, and then appends a single quote. It updates the pos index and the lastHold position accordingly.\n11. If the current character is a quote, the method returns the appendTo buffer with the characters between the lastHold position and the current position appended.\n12. If none of the above conditions match, the method moves to the next character.\n13. If the end of the pattern is reached without encountering an unescaped quote, an exception is thrown.\n14. After applying the pattern, the `ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor sets the `toPattern` field to the modified pattern returned by `insertFormats`.\n15. The bug is that the `appendQuotedString` method does not handle escaping correctly. It only checks if the current character is a quote, but it does not handle the case where the quote is escaped. This causes the `appendQuotedString` method to keep appending characters and potentially run into an `OutOfMemoryError` when the buffer size exceeds the available heap space.\n\nTo fix this bug, we should modify the `appendQuotedString` method to correctly handle the escaping of quotes.\n\nSuggestions for methods to be fixed:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.appendQuotedString(java.lang.String, java.text.ParsePosition, java.lang.StringBuffer, boolean)`"

The failing test `org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormatTest.testEscapedQuote_LANG_477()` is testing the `testEscapedQuote_LANG_477` method in the `ExtendedMessageFormatTest` class.\n2. In the test, the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class is instantiated with a pattern containing an escaped quote.\n3. The `ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor is called with the pattern and a registry.\n4. Inside the `ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor, the `applyPattern` method is called, passing the pattern as an argument.\n5. The `applyPattern` method starts by checking if the registry is `null`. If it is `null`, the method calls the `super.applyPattern` method and sets the `toPattern` field to the result.\n6. If the registry is not `null`, the method initializes some variables and starts processing the pattern character by character.\n7. When encountering a quote character (`'`), the method calls the `appendQuotedString` method to handle the quoted string.\n8. The `appendQuotedString` method checks if escaping is enabled and if the current character is a quote. If so, it returns the appendTo buffer with a single quote appended.\n9. If the escaping is not enabled or the current character is not a quote, the method iterates over the remaining characters in the pattern.\n10. If escaping is enabled and the next characters match the `ESCAPED_QUOTE` string, the method appends the characters between the lastHold position and the current position to the appendTo buffer, and then appends a single quote. It updates the pos index and the lastHold position accordingly.\n11. If the current character is a quote, the method returns the appendTo buffer with the characters between the lastHold position and the current position appended.\n12. If none of the above conditions match, the method moves to the next character.\n13. If the end of the pattern is reached without encountering an unescaped quote, an exception is thrown.\n14. After applying the pattern, the `ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor sets the `toPattern` field to the modified pattern returned by `insertFormats`.\n15. The bug is that the `appendQuotedString` method does not handle escaping correctly. It only checks if the current character is a quote, but it does not handle the case where the quote is escaped. This causes the `appendQuotedString` method to keep appending characters and potentially run into an `OutOfMemoryError` when the buffer size exceeds the available heap space.\n\nTo fix this bug, we should modify the `appendQuotedString` method to correctly handle the escaping of quotes.\n\nSuggestions for methods to be fixed:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.appendQuotedString(java.lang.String, java.text.ParsePosition, java.lang.StringBuffer, boolean)`"
