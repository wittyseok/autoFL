Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tests about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

The test code is as follows:\n\n```java\n3771 :   public void testBadInterfaceExtendsNonExistentInterfaces() throws Exception {\n3772 :     String js = \"/** @interface \\n\" +\n3773 :         \" * @extends {nonExistent1} \\n\" +\n3774 :         \" * @extends {nonExistent2} \\n\" +\n3775 :         \" */function A() {}\";\n3776 :     String[] expectedWarnings = {\n3777 :       \"Bad type annotation.

Unknown type nonExistent2\"\n3779 :     };\n3780 :     testTypes(js, expectedWarnings); // error occurred here\n3781 :   }\n```\n\nThe test invokes the `testTypes` method with a JavaScript code snippet and an array of expected warning messages. The JavaScript code defines an interface `A` with the `@extends` annotation, specifying two non-existent interfaces `nonExistent1` and `nonExistent2`. The test expects two warning messages indicating the bad type annotations.\n\nThe test failure is caused by a `NullPointerException` in the `checkInterfaceConflictProperties` method of the `TypeCheck` class at line 1574. This suggests that there is a problem with checking conflicting properties of interfaces.\n\nBased on the test code and the error message, it appears that the `TypeCheck` class is not handling the case of extending non-existent interfaces properly, leading to the `NullPointerException`.\n\nTo fix the bug, the `TypeCheck` class should be modified to handle the case of extending non-existent interfaces and provide appropriate error/warning messages instead of throwing a `NullPointerException`.\nSuggested fix locations:\n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkInterfaceConflictProperties()` \n- `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest.testBadInterfaceExtendsNonExistentInterfaces()`"
