This leads to a `NullPointerException` when trying to invoke `getClass` on a `null` object.\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to handle the case when an element in the input array is `null`. One possible approach is to skip the `null` elements and replace them with a default `Class` object, such as `java.lang.Object.class`, in the resulting array.\nBased on the diagnosis, the bug occurred because the `toClass` method in the `ClassUtils` class does not handle the case when an element in the input array is `null`. This leads to a `NullPointerException` when trying to invoke `getClass` on a `null` object.\n\nTo fix this bug, the following method needs to be modified:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.lang3.ClassUtils.toClass(java.lang.Object[])\n```\n\nThe fix should handle the case when an element in the input array is `null` and replace it with a default `Class` object, such as `java.lang.Object.class`, in the resulting array.\n\nPlease note that this is just a suggested fix based on the information provided. The actual fix may require further analysis of the code and understanding of the requirements.\n\n"
