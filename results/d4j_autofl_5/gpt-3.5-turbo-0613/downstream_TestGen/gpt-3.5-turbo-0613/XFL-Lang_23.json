The registry maps have different `FormatFactory` instances, despite having the same keys. The test then asserts that the two objects are not equal and have different hash codes.\n\nThe second test, `testSimilarButPasses()`, is similar to `testReproducesBug()` but does not trigger the bug. It creates two `ExtendedMessageFormat` objects with the same registry map, but the `FormatFactory` instances are re-initialized. The test then asserts that the two objects are equal and have the same hash code."
