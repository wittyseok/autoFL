However, the code does not compare the new value of the `draw` parameter with the current value of `plotLines` to check if they are different.\n\nTo fix this bug, the `setDrawLines` method should be modified to compare the new value of `draw` with the current value of `plotLines`. If they are different, the `plotLines` flag should be updated, and a `RendererChangeEvent` should be triggered. This will ensure that the test `MinMaxCategoryRendererTests.testEquals` correctly detects the difference in states between two instances of `MinMaxCategoryRenderer`.\n\nProposed fix:\n\n```java\npublic void setDrawLines(boolean draw) {\n    if (this.plotLines != draw) {\n        this.plotLines = draw;\n        this.notifyListeners(new RendererChangeEvent(this));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe fix should be applied to the `setDrawLines` method of the `org.jfree.chart.renderer.category.MinMaxCategoryRenderer` class."
