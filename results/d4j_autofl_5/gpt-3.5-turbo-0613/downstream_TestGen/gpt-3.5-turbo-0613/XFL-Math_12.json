Then, it clones the distribution using the `deepClone()` method. Finally, it compares the samples generated from the original distribution and the cloned distribution using the `assertEquals` assertion.\n\nThe test failure occurs at line 394, where the test expects the samples from the original and cloned distributions to be equal, but the actual values are different. The expected value is `23.951334711900845`, but the actual value is `1.9236285029185378`.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, let's retrieve the code snippet for the `LogNormalDistribution(double, double)` constructor.\nThe `LogNormalDistribution` class has a constructor `LogNormalDistribution(double scale, double shape)` which throws a `NotStrictlyPositiveException`. The constructor initializes an instance of `LogNormalDistribution` with the given `scale` and `shape` parameters, using a default inverse absolute accuracy.\n\nBased on the failing test and the code snippet of the constructor, it seems that the issue might not be related to the constructor itself.\n\nNext, let's retrieve the code snippet for the `sample()` method of the `LogNormalDistribution` class."
