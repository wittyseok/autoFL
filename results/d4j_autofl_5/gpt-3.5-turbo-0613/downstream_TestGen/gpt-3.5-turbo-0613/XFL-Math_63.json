                "content": "The `.equals(double, double)` method in the `MathUtils` class is implemented as follows:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean equals(double x, double y) {\n    return (Double.isNaN(x) && Double.isNaN(y)) || x == y;\n}\n```\n\nThe method returns `true` if both `x` and `y` are `Double.NaN`, or if `x` is equal to `y` based on the default `==` comparison. \n\nBased on the failing test and the implementation of the `.equals(double[], double[])` method, it appears that the issue lies in the handling of `Double.NaN` values. The test is expecting `false`, but the method is returning `true`.\n\nTo fix the bug, we need to update the `.equals(double, double)` method to return `false` if both `x` and `y` are `Double.NaN`, as `Double.NaN` is not equal to itself.\nThe bug occurred because the implementation of the `MathUtils.equals(double, double)` method does not handle the case where both `x` and `y` are `Double.NaN`. Currently, the method returns `true` in this case, which is incorrect because `Double.NaN` is not equal to itself.\n\nTo fix this bug, the implementation of the `MathUtils.equals(double, double)` method needs to be updated to return `false` if both `x` and `y` are `Double.NaN`.\n\nThe method that needs to be fixed is:\n- `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.equals(double, double)`\n\nTo fix the bug, update the method as follows:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean equals(double x, double y) {\n    return !(Double.isNaN(x) && Double.isNaN(y)) && x == y;\n}\n```\n\nThis updated implementation correctly handles the case where both `x` and `y` are `Double.NaN` by returning `false`.\n\nPlease note that this is just a suggestion based on the analysis of the failing test and the code snippets provided. It is recommended to review the codebase and test it thoroughly after making any changes."
