However, the test is failing with the error message \"One or more errors detected\". Looking at the code snippet of `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE`, we can see that it simply returns a clone of the `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE` array.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, we need to look at the code snippet of the `invert` method in the same class. This method is not directly called in the failing test, but it might be related to the issue.\n\nAfter calling the `get_code_snippet` function for the `invert` method, we can see that it takes a two-dimensional string array as input and returns a new array with the elements inverted. This method might be used somewhere else in the code and could potentially be the cause of the error.\n\nNext, let's analyze the failing test to understand the exact cause of the failure.\n\nWe can see that the test initializes two empty sets (`col0` and `col1`) and a two-dimensional string array (`sa`) by calling the `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE` method. Then, it iterates over the elements of the `sa` array and tries to add the first and second element of each sub-array to the corresponding set (`col0` and `col1`). If an element is already present in the set, it sets the `success` flag to false and prints an error message.\n\nFinally, the test asserts that the `success` flag is true, indicating that no duplicate entries were found. However, the test fails with the assertion error \"One or more errors detected\".\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that there might be duplicate entries in the `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE` array, which are not correctly handled by the `invert` method.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can modify the `invert` method to handle duplicate entries correctly, or we can investigate the `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE` array to ensure that it does not contain any duplicates.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Modify `EntityArrays.invert` to handle duplicate entries correctly.\n\nPlease note that further investigation is required to determine the exact cause of the failure and the appropriate fix.\nSuggested fixes:\n- Modify `org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays.invert(java.lang.String[][])`\n- Investigate `org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays.ISO8859_1_ESCAPE()` to ensure it does not contain duplicate entries."

However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.

However, the test is failing with the error message \"One or more errors detected\". Looking at the code snippet of `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE`, we can see that it simply returns a clone of the `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE` array.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, we need to look at the code snippet of the `invert` method in the same class. This method is not directly called in the failing test, but it might be related to the issue.\n\nAfter calling the `get_code_snippet` function for the `invert` method, we can see that it takes a two-dimensional string array as input and returns a new array with the elements inverted. This method might be used somewhere else in the code and could potentially be the cause of the error.\n\nNext, let's analyze the failing test to understand the exact cause of the failure.\n\nWe can see that the test initializes two empty sets (`col0` and `col1`) and a two-dimensional string array (`sa`) by calling the `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE` method. Then, it iterates over the elements of the `sa` array and tries to add the first and second element of each sub-array to the corresponding set (`col0` and `col1`). If an element is already present in the set, it sets the `success` flag to false and prints an error message.\n\nFinally, the test asserts that the `success` flag is true, indicating that no duplicate entries were found. However, the test fails with the assertion error \"One or more errors detected\".\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that there might be duplicate entries in the `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE` array, which are not correctly handled by the `invert` method.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can modify the `invert` method to handle duplicate entries correctly, or we can investigate the `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE` array to ensure that it does not contain any duplicates.\n\nSuggested fix:\n- Modify `EntityArrays.invert` to handle duplicate entries correctly.\n\nPlease note that further investigation is required to determine the exact cause of the failure and the appropriate fix.\nSuggested fixes:\n- Modify `org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays.invert(java.lang.String[][])`\n- Investigate `org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays.ISO8859_1_ESCAPE()` to ensure it does not contain duplicate entries."
