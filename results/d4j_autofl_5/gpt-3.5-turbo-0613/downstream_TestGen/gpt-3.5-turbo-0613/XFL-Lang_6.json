The error occurred in the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeCsv` method of `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils` class.\n\nBased on the test code and the error message, we can see that the test is trying to escape a surrogate pair in a CSV value, but it resulted in an index out of range error.\n\nTo further investigate this issue, we can look at the code of the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeCsv` method. Here is a snippet of the relevant code:\n\n```java\n1763 :     public static String escapeCsv(String input) {\n1764 :         if (StringUtils.containsNone(input, CSV_SEARCH_CHARS)) {\n1765 :             return input;\n1766 :         }\n1767 :         try {\n1768 :             StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(input.length() * 2);\n1769 :             escapeCsv(input, writer);\n1770 :             return writer.toString();\n1771 :         } catch (IOException ioe) {\n1772 :             // Should never happen with a StringWriter\n1773 :             throw new UnhandledException(ioe);\n1774 :         }\n1775 :     }\n```\n\nIt appears that the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeCsv` method first checks if the input string contains any characters that need to be escaped. If not, it simply returns the input string as is. Otherwise, it creates a `StringWriter` object to write the escaped CSV value and then returns the resulting string.\n\nTo find the root cause of the error, we need to investigate the `StringUtils.containsNone` method, which is called in the `escapeCsv` method.

                "content": "The test `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtilsTest.testEscapeSurrogatePairs` failed with a `java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The error occurred in the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeCsv` method of `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils` class.\n\nBased on the test code and the error message, we can see that the test is trying to escape a surrogate pair in a CSV value, but it resulted in an index out of range error.\n\nTo further investigate this issue, we can look at the code of the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeCsv` method. Here is a snippet of the relevant code:\n\n```java\n1763 :     public static String escapeCsv(String input) {\n1764 :         if (StringUtils.containsNone(input, CSV_SEARCH_CHARS)) {\n1765 :             return input;\n1766 :         }\n1767 :         try {\n1768 :             StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(input.length() * 2);\n1769 :             escapeCsv(input, writer);\n1770 :             return writer.toString();\n1771 :         } catch (IOException ioe) {\n1772 :             // Should never happen with a StringWriter\n1773 :             throw new UnhandledException(ioe);\n1774 :         }\n1775 :     }\n```\n\nIt appears that the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeCsv` method first checks if the input string contains any characters that need to be escaped. If not, it simply returns the input string as is. Otherwise, it creates a `StringWriter` object to write the escaped CSV value and then returns the resulting string.\n\nTo find the root cause of the error, we need to investigate the `StringUtils.containsNone` method, which is called in the `escapeCsv` method. Here is a snippet of the relevant code:\n\n```java\n1736 :     public static boolean containsNone(CharSequence cs, char... searchChars) {\n1737 :         if (cs == null || searchChars == null) {\n1738 :             return true;\n1739 :         }\n1740 :         int csLen = cs.length();\n1741 :         int csLast = csLen - 1;\n1742 :         int searchLen = searchChars.length;\n1743 :         int searchLast = searchLen - 1;\n1744 :         for (int i = 0; i < csLen; i++) {\n1745 :             char ch = cs.charAt(i);\n1746 :             for (int j = 0; j < searchLen; j++) {\n1747 :                 if (searchChars[j] == ch) {\n1748 :                     if (Character.isHighSurrogate(ch)) {\n1749 :                         if (j == searchLast) {\n1750 :                             // missing low surrogate, fine, like String.indexOf(String)\n1751 :                             return false;\n1752 :                         }\n1753 :                         if (i < csLast && searchChars[j + 1] == cs.charAt(i + 1)) {\n1754 :                             return false;\n1755 :                         }\n1756 :                     } else {\n1757 :                         // ch is in the Basic Multilingual Plane\n1758 :                         return false;\n1759 :                     }\n1760 :                 }\n1761 :             }\n1762 :         }\n1763 :         return true;\n1764 :     }\n```\n\nThe `StringUtils.containsNone` method checks if any character in the input sequence `cs` is present in the `searchChars` array. If a match is found, it performs additional checks for surrogate pairs. If it encounters a high surrogate character, it checks for the presence of a low surrogate character in the next position of the input sequence and returns `false` if it is found. Otherwise, it continues searching for a match.\n\nFrom the information gathered so far, it seems that the error occurred because the `StringUtils.containsNone` method did not handle the surrogate pair correctly, leading to an index out of range error in the subsequent code.\n\nTo fix this issue, the `StringUtils.containsNone` method should be modified to handle surrogate pairs properly. One possible fix could be to check for a low surrogate character whenever a high surrogate character is encountered and return `false` if it is not found.\n\nBased on our analysis, the method that needs to be fixed is:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence, char...)\n```\n"
