The coefficients `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` are computed using intermediate variables `sx2`, `sy2`, `sxy`, `sxz`, and `syz`. After the computations, an if statement checks if the ratios `c1 / c2` and `c2 / c3` are negative. If one of them is negative, an exception is thrown indicating that the observations cannot be fitted with a sensible result. Otherwise, the amplitude (`a`) and the pulsation (`omega`) are computed.\n\nNext, let's look at the `guessPhi` method. This method computes the phase (`phi`) of the harmonic function based on the mean values of `fc` and `fs`. The values are computed in a loop over the observations. The phase is computed using the `atan2` function.\n\nBased on the code analysis, it seems that the test failed because the exception was not thrown when it was expected to be thrown by the `guessAOmega` method.

It first sorts the observations using the `sortObservations` method, and then proceeds to estimate the amplitude (`a`), the pulsation (`omega`), and the phase (`phi`) of the harmonic function using the `guessAOmega` and `guessPhi` methods, respectively.\n\nThe failing test indicates that the `guess` method did not throw the expected exception. However, we can see that no exception is explicitly thrown in the code snippet provided.\n\nTo investigate further, let's examine the `guessAOmega` method. This method computes the amplitude and pulsation coefficients of the harmonic function based on the sorted observations. The coefficients `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` are computed using intermediate variables `sx2`, `sy2`, `sxy`, `sxz`, and `syz`. After the computations, an if statement checks if the ratios `c1 / c2` and `c2 / c3` are negative. If one of them is negative, an exception is thrown indicating that the observations cannot be fitted with a sensible result. Otherwise, the amplitude (`a`) and the pulsation (`omega`) are computed.\n\nNext, let's look at the `guessPhi` method. This method computes the phase (`phi`) of the harmonic function based on the mean values of `fc` and `fs`. The values are computed in a loop over the observations. The phase is computed using the `atan2` function.\n\nBased on the code analysis, it seems that the test failed because the exception was not thrown when it was expected to be thrown by the `guessAOmega` method. To fix this issue, we need to throw the `MathIllegalStateException` when the ratios `c1 / c2` and `c2 / c3` are negative in the `guess"
