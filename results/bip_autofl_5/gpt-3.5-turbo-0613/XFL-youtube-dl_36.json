The test attempts to assert that the `suitable` method of `FacebookIE` returns `True` for a given URL. However, the assertion failed because the method returned `False` instead of `True`. The error occurs in the following line of code:\n\n```python\nself.assertTrue(FacebookIE.suitable('https://www.facebook.com/cindyweather?fref=ts#!/photo.php?v=10152183998945793'))\n```\n\nNext, I retrieved the covered packages and found that the failing test is related to the `youtube_dl.extractor` package. Specifically, it belongs to the `youtube_dl.extractor.__init__` module.\n\nLooking at the code snippet for the `gen_extractors` and `get_info_extractor` methods in the `youtube_dl.extractor.__init__` class, I can see that the `gen_extractors` method returns a list of instances of every supported extractor. The order of the extractors in the list matters, as the first extractor matched is the one handling the URL. The `get_info_extractor` method returns the info extractor class with the given `ie_name`.\n\nBased on this information, it seems like the issue lies with the `suitable` method of the `FacebookIE` class. It is likely that the `suitable` method is returning `False` for the given URL, which is causing the test to fail.\n\nTo further investigate the issue and suggest a fix, I would need to access the code snippet for the `suitable` method of the `FacebookIE` class. Could you please provide the code snippet for that method?"
